      "Umm, thank you.\n",
      "So which social media platforms are using currently?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1  1:10\n",
      "Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi 1:22\n",
      "And Tiktok.\n",
      "OK umm so.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you've been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so?\n",

      "P1   1:41\n",
      "Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I first started using it.\n",
      "And I was definitely a lot more active on it early on.\n",
      "I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much.\n",

      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1  2:20\n",
      "So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much.\n",
      "And my friends aren't.\n",
      "I don't go it on it too much anymore.\n",
      "I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing.\n",

      "Shristi   2:36\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   2:51\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notifications from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   3:16\n",
      "OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   3:23\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while.\n",

      "Yeah, and.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   3:34\n",
      "And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot.\n",
      "So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends.\n",
      "Like if I think of them every once in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   3:54\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   4:03\n",
      "Umm, I actually have not used it.\n",
      "I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my first thought was like I really had no interest in trying it.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   4:20\n",
      "Yeah. OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   4:21\n",
      "It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it.\n",
      "Like back when it was first released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   4:53\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, of course.\n",
      "Ohm.\n",
      "So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:06\n",
      "Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI?\n",
      "So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:23\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:27\n",
      "If you remember it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:29\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:35\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:37\n",
      "OK, sure.\n",
      "So the one I remember the most was my first time using it.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:56\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:00\n",
      "And so for that one.\n",
      "I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:07\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:08\n",
      "Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:16\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:16\n",
      "So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar.\n",
      "So like I think the first thing I said was like, hi, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:32\n",
      "Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:41\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:42\n",
      "So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that.\n",
      "And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.\n",
      "And I've noticed that my like conversation.\n",
      "No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, at first I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   8:15\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   8:34\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   8:35\n",
      "And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the final recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night.\n",
      "So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary.\n",
      "I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   9:30\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   9:45\n",
      "And I'm like, I don't know about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   9:48\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   9:48\n",
      "And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources.\n",
      "Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:46\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   10:46\n",
      "And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:55\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   10:58\n",
      "Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:59\n",
      "Umm, you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:02\n",
      "I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip.\n",
      "Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   11:14\n",
      "Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:27\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   11:28\n",
      "So yeah, so much for sharing that.\n",
      "So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:37\n",
      "Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   12:24\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   12:24\n",
      "Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me?\n",
      "And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   12:40\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   12:43\n",
      "A recommendation was definitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   13:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm, OK, thank you.\n",
      "So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   13:34\n",
      "Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation.\n",
      "I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   13:55\n",
      "Hmm hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   14:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option.\n",
      "Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should have like asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   14:52\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   14:56\n",
      "Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   15:10\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   15:11\n",
      "It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   15:30\n",
      "Umm. Given of course.\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   15:46\n",
      "Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   16:30\n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   16:33\n",
      "So pretty effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   16:36\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   16:47\n",
      "Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   17:01\n",
      "You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations.\n",
      "Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed.\n",
      "And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:42\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   17:44\n",
      "So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:52\n",
      "OK, so did you encounter any specific obstacles when you were using the tool?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:05\n",
      "And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:29\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:43\n",
      "Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:49\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:52\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Can you guys hear me alright?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:54\n",
      "Yeah, we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:56\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like.\n",
      "Can you give me links with pictures?\n",
      "So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing.\n",
      "But in other times.\n",
      "I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like specific models of backpacks within this brand and like specific colors.\n",
      "It then gave me specific models but not specific colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   20:00\n",
      "Umm. OK. Makes sense.\n",
      "So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the specific feature properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   20:27\n",
      "Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   20:50\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:12\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   21:14\n",
      "So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:18\n",
      "Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   21:48\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:48\n",
      "Uh, or like banter with it?\n",
      "And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.\n",
      "So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one specifically, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   22:32\n",
      "Oh really?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   22:33\n",
      "Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   22:43\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   22:46\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it.\n",
      "That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer.\n",
      "Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:07\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:11\n",
      "Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:21\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:23\n",
      "So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:28\n",
      "OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:43\n",
      "Umm, I would say no.\n",
      "Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny.\n",
      "But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   24:10\n",
      "Makes sense.\n",
      "Ohm so.\n",
      "So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   24:26\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh.\n",
      "What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:36\n",
      "So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:36\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:41\n",
      "Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:45\n",
      "Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:49\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:50\n",
      "So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:04\n",
      "No, I I don't think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:07\n",
      "Hmm, OK.\n",
      "So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:21\n",
      "I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:27\n",
      "Umm so so.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:28\n",
      "Which is just, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:30\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT.\n",
      "So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:49\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   27:20\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   27:29\n",
      "Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   28:21\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm yeah, sure.\n",
      "So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   28:40\n",
      "I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm.\n",
      "I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure.\n",
      "Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need.\n",
      "And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not specifically asking like the Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   29:51\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "OK. Makes sense.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:08\n",
      "Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:22\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:31\n",
      "Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:35\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:36\n",
      "Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:06\n",
      "Yeah, I think that's that's fair.\n",
      "So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   31:19\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Ohh no, I don't think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:28\n",
      "Ohh OK really OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   31:30\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:32\n",
      "Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding back and giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   31:48\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:49\n",
      "And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:02\n",
      "Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:10\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:11\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:11\n",
      "So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:15\n",
      "It just knows, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:17\n",
      "Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then.\n",
      "OK, so so when you receive any recommendations.\n",
      "So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:42\n",
      "Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:06\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:08\n",
      "Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:29\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:33\n",
      "It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:45\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you finish the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:53\n",
      "I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   34:11\n",
      "Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   34:42\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   34:42\n",
      "Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reflect back on that experience a little bit for us?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   34:53\n",
      "Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to fly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   35:15\n",
      "This is.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   35:20\n",
      "And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   35:27\n",
      "Umm. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   35:32\n",
      "And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it.\n",
      "Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes?\n",
      "And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:11\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:22\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:24\n",
      "Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:34\n",
      "Ohh yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:34\n",
      "Ohm, I'm so.\n",
      "So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:42\n",
      "Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:56\n",
      "Ask it to recommend a filter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and first of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:11\n",
      "So I don't know what that was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:15\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:16\n",
      "But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a filter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat filter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the filter homepage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:45\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:47\n",
      "Of the camera like tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:49\n",
      "The where we where we take, where we take new snaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:53\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:00\n",
      "It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that specific cat filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:04\n",
      "That OK. Umm, so.\n",
      "So when you were not able to reach the specific filter, how how did it make you feel at the time?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:19\n",
      "You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this filter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:45\n",
      "Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:49\n",
      "Yeah. Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:51\n",
      "OK. Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.\n",
      "So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more specific I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   39:17\n",
      "Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   39:24\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   39:45\n",
      "Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times.\n",
      "So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   40:11\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   40:31\n",
      "But I wouldn't take it at face value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   40:38\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   40:40\n",
      "And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:01\n",
      "Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account?\n",
      "Does it know how expensive it is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:09\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:11\n",
      "Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:15\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:16\n",
      "It's like for like minute details.\n",
      "I I would do that research on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:23\n",
      "Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:34\n",
      "Basically, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:35\n",
      "Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   42:11\n",
      "Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   42:37\n",
      "I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   42:41\n",
      "So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   42:52\n",
      "Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reflecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   43:16\n",
      "Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively.\n",
      "Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to figure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality or something to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   44:02\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:05\n",
      "I have a quick question.\n",
      "I have a quick question.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:09\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:09\n",
      "Just before finishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:24\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:27\n",
      "I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to figure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:54\n",
      "Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   45:13\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   45:13\n",
      "Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human.\n",
      "And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   45:29\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   45:32\n",
      "Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the Snapchat AI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   46:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hmm, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   46:17\n",
      "Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for specifically for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   46:37\n",
      "Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:01\n",
      "I'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games.\n",
      "Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:09\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:11\n",
      "Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games.\n",
      "Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:30\n",
      "If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:49\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:59\n",
      "So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:07\n",
      "Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   48:14\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:17\n",
      "That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   48:47\n",
      "Uh, could you say that again? So like uh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:51\n",
      "Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   49:09\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   49:29\n",
      "And how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   49:49\n",
      "Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   50:07\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",

      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   50:15\n",
      "And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more.\n",

      "\n",
      "Shristi   1:02\n",
      "Umm, thank you.\n",
      "So which social media platforms are using currently?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1  1:10\n",
      "Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi 1:22\n",
      "And Tiktok.\n",
      "OK umm so.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so?\n",

      "P1  1:31\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",

      "Do you remember when you started using Snapchat?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   1:41\n",
      "Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I first started using it.\n",
      "And I was definitely a lot more active on it early on.\n",
      "I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much.\n",
      "And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   2:15\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1  2:20\n",
      "So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much.\n",
      "And my friends aren't.\n",
      "I don't go it on it too much anymore.\n",
      "I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   2:36\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   2:51\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notifications from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   3:16\n",
      "OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   3:23\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   3:30\n",
      "Yeah, and.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   3:34\n",
      "And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot.\n",
      "So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends.\n",
      "Like if I think of them every once in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   3:54\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   4:03\n",
      "Umm, I actually have not used it.\n",
      "I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my first thought was like I really had no interest in trying it.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   4:20\n",
      "Yeah. OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   4:21\n",
      "It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it.\n",
      "Like back when it was first released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   4:53\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, of course.\n",
      "Ohm.\n",
      "So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:06\n",
      "Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI?\n",
      "So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:23\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:27\n",
      "If you remember it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:29\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:35\n",
      "Yeah, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   5:37\n",
      "OK, sure.\n",
      "So the one I remember the most was my first time using it.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   5:56\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:00\n",
      "And so for that one.\n",
      "I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:07\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:08\n",
      "Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:16\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:16\n",
      "So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar.\n",
      "So like I think the first thing I said was like, hi, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:32\n",
      "Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   6:41\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   6:42\n",
      "So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that.\n",
      "And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.\n",
      "And I've noticed that my like conversation.\n",
      "No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, at first I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   8:15\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   8:34\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   8:35\n",
      "And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the final recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night.\n",
      "So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary.\n",
      "I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   9:30\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   9:45\n",
      "And I'm like, I don't know about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   9:48\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   9:48\n",
      "And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources.\n",
      "Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:46\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   10:46\n",
      "And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:55\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   10:58\n",
      "Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   10:59\n",
      "Umm, you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:02\n",
      "I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip.\n",
      "Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   11:14\n",
      "Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:27\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   11:28\n",
      "So yeah, so much for sharing that.\n",
      "So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   11:37\n",
      "Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   12:24\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   12:24\n",
      "Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me?\n",
      "And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   12:40\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   12:43\n",
      "A recommendation was definitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   13:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm, OK, thank you.\n",
      "So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   13:34\n",
      "Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation.\n",
      "I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   13:55\n",
      "Hmm hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   14:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option.\n",
      "Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should have like asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   14:52\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   14:56\n",
      "Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   15:10\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   15:11\n",
      "It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   15:30\n",
      "Umm. Given of course.\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   15:46\n",
      "Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   16:30\n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   16:33\n",
      "So pretty effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   16:36\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   16:47\n",
      "Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   17:01\n",
      "You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations.\n",
      "Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed.\n",
      "And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:42\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   17:44\n",
      "So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   17:52\n",
      "OK, so did you encounter any specific obstacles when you were using the tool?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:05\n",
      "And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:29\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:43\n",
      "Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:49\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:52\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Can you guys hear me alright?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   18:54\n",
      "Yeah, we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   18:56\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like.\n",
      "Can you give me links with pictures?\n",
      "So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing.\n",
      "But in other times.\n",
      "I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like specific models of backpacks within this brand and like specific colors.\n",
      "It then gave me specific models but not specific colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   20:00\n",
      "Umm. OK. Makes sense.\n",
      "So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the specific feature properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   20:27\n",
      "Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   20:50\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:12\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   21:14\n",
      "So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:18\n",
      "Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   21:48\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   21:48\n",
      "Uh, or like banter with it?\n",
      "And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.\n",
      "So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one specifically, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   22:32\n",
      "Oh really?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   22:33\n",
      "Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   22:43\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   22:46\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it.\n",
      "That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer.\n",
      "Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:07\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:11\n",
      "Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:21\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:23\n",
      "So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   23:28\n",
      "OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   23:43\n",
      "Umm, I would say no.\n",
      "Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny.\n",
      "But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   24:10\n",
      "Makes sense.\n",
      "Ohm so.\n",
      "So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   24:26\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh.\n",
      "What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:36\n",
      "So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:36\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:41\n",
      "Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:45\n",
      "Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   25:49\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   25:50\n",
      "So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:04\n",
      "No, I I don't think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:07\n",
      "Hmm, OK.\n",
      "So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:21\n",
      "I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:27\n",
      "Umm so so.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:28\n",
      "Which is just, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   26:30\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT.\n",
      "So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   26:49\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   27:20\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   27:29\n",
      "Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   28:21\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm yeah, sure.\n",
      "So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   28:40\n",
      "I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm.\n",
      "I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure.\n",
      "Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need.\n",
      "And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not specifically asking like the Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   29:51\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "OK. Makes sense.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:08\n",
      "Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:22\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:31\n",
      "Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:35\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   30:36\n",
      "Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:06\n",
      "Yeah, I think that's that's fair.\n",
      "So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   31:19\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Ohh no, I don't think so.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:32\n",
      "Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding back and giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   31:48\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:49\n",
      "And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:02\n",
      "Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:10\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:11\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:11\n",
      "So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:15\n",
      "It just knows, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:17\n",
      "Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then.\n",
      "OK, so so when you receive any recommendations.\n",
      "So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   32:42\n",
      "Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:06\n",
      "OK, makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:08\n",
      "Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:29\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:33\n",
      "It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   33:45\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you finish the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   33:53\n",
      "I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   34:11\n",
      "Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   34:42\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   34:42\n",
      "Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reflect back on that experience a little bit for us?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   34:53\n",
      "Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to fly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   35:15\n",
      "This is.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   35:20\n",
      "And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   35:27\n",
      "Umm. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   35:32\n",
      "And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it.\n",
      "Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes?\n",
      "And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:11\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:22\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:24\n",
      "Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:34\n",
      "Ohh yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:34\n",
      "Ohm, I'm so.\n",
      "So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:42\n",
      "Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   36:56\n",
      "Ask it to recommend a filter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and first of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:11\n",
      "So I don't know what that was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:15\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:16\n",
      "But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a filter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat filter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the filter homepage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:45\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:47\n",
      "Of the camera like tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   37:49\n",
      "The where we where we take, where we take new snaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   37:53\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:00\n",
      "It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that specific cat filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:04\n",
      "That OK. Umm, so.\n",
      "So when you were not able to reach the specific filter, how how did it make you feel at the time?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:19\n",
      "You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this filter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:45\n",
      "Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   38:49\n",
      "Yeah. Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   38:51\n",
      "OK. Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.\n",
      "So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more specific I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   39:17\n",
      "Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   39:24\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   39:45\n",
      "Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times.\n",
      "So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   40:11\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   40:31\n",
      "But I wouldn't take it at face value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   40:38\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   40:40\n",
      "And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:01\n",
      "Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account?\n",
      "Does it know how expensive it is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:09\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:11\n",
      "Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:15\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:16\n",
      "It's like for like minute details.\n",
      "I I would do that research on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:23\n",
      "Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   41:34\n",
      "Basically, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   41:35\n",
      "Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   42:11\n",
      "Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   42:37\n",
      "I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   42:41\n",
      "So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   42:52\n",
      "Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reflecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   43:16\n",
      "Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively.\n",
      "Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to figure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality or something to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   44:02\n",
      "OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:05\n",
      "I have a quick question.\n",
      "I have a quick question.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:09\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:09\n",
      "Just before finishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:24\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   44:27\n",
      "I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to figure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   44:54\n",
      "Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   45:13\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   45:13\n",
      "Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human.\n",
      "And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   45:29\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   45:32\n",
      "Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the Snapchat AI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   46:06\n",
      "Umm.\n",

      "\n",
      "Shristi   46:17\n",
      "Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for specifically for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   46:37\n",
      "Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:01\n",

      "Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:09\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:11\n",
      "Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games.\n",
      "Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:30\n",
      "If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   47:49\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   47:59\n",
      "So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:07\n",
      "Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here.\n",
      "\n",

      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:17\n",
      "That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1   48:47\n",
      "Uh, could you say that again? So like uh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   48:51\n",
      "Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "P1   49:49\n",
      "Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   50:07\n",

      "\n",
      "P1   50:15\n",
      "And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more.\n",

      "Transcript P1_Interview March 11, 2024, 7:05PM Shristi 0:07 Ok. OK, so we have started the recording and transcription. I just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself? P1 0:21 Sure. Umm. So my name is [--]. I'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program. This is my second to last semester. Umm before that I'm. I'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years. Decided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer. Shristi 1:02 Umm, thank you. So which social media platforms are using currently? P1 1:10 Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok. Shristi 1:22 And Tiktok. OK umm so. Umm. So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so? P1 1:31 Umm. Shristi 1:38 Do you remember when you started using Snapchat? P1 1:41 Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I ﬁrst started using it.And I was deﬁnitely a lot more active on it early on. I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much. And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories. Shristi 2:15 Umm. P1 2:20 So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much. And my friends aren't. I don't go it on it too much anymore. I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing. Shristi 2:36 Umm. OK. So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera? P1 2:51 Yeah. So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notiﬁcations from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories. Shristi 3:16 OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family? P1 3:23 I do. It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while. Shristi 3:30 Yeah, and. P1 3:34 And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot. So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends. Like if I think of them every once in a while.Shristi 3:54 Hmm. OK, makes sense. So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study? P1 4:03 Umm, I actually have not used it. I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my ﬁrst thought was like I really had no interest in trying it. Umm. Shristi 4:20 Yeah. OK. P1 4:21 It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it. Like back when it was ﬁrst released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out. Shristi 4:53 Yeah, yeah, of course. Ohm. So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now. P1 5:06 Umm. Shristi 5:06 Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI? So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went. P1 5:23 Sure. Shristi 5:27 If you remember it. P1 5:29 Yeah. So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?Shristi 5:35 Yeah, of course. P1 5:37 OK, sure. So the one I remember the most was my ﬁrst time using it. Umm. And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US. Shristi 5:56 Umm. P1 6:00 And so for that one. I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me. Shristi 6:07 Umm. P1 6:08 Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good. Shristi 6:16 Mm-hmm. P1 6:16 So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar. So like I think the ﬁrst thing I said was like, hi, how are you? Shristi 6:28 Umm. P1 6:32 Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model. Shristi 6:41 No. P1 6:42 So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that. And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.And I've noticed that my like conversation. No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back. Well, at ﬁrst I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts. P1 8:15 Umm. So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions. Shristi 8:34 Umm. P1 8:35 And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the ﬁnal recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night. So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary. I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by. Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days. Shristi 9:30 Umm. P1 9:45 And I'm like, I don't know about that. Shristi 9:48 Yeah.P1 9:48 And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources. Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in. Shristi 10:46 Mm-hmm. P1 10:46 And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore. Shristi 10:55 Yeah. P1 10:58 Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like. Shristi 10:59 Umm, you know? P1 11:02 I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip. Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was ﬁne. Shristi 11:14 Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else. P1 11:27 Yeah. Shristi 11:28 So yeah, so much for sharing that. So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?P1 11:37 Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better. Shristi 12:24 Umm. P1 12:24 Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me? And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary. Shristi 12:40 Umm. P1 12:43 A recommendation was deﬁnitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker. Shristi 13:01 Umm. Umm, OK, thank you. So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back? P1 13:34 Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation. I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time. Shristi 13:55 Hmm hmm. P1 14:06 Umm. Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option. Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should havelike asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews. Shristi 14:52 Mm-hmm. P1 14:56 Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products. Shristi 15:10 Yep. P1 15:11 It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that. Shristi 15:30 Umm. Given of course. OK, makes sense. So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot? P1 15:46 Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time. Shristi 16:30 Umm OK. P1 16:33 So pretty effortless. Shristi 16:36 OK. So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well? P1 16:47 Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.Shristi 17:00 Umm. P1 17:01 You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations. Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed. And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human. Shristi 17:42 Umm. P1 17:44 So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it. Shristi 17:52 OK, so did you encounter any speciﬁc obstacles when you were using the tool? P1 18:05 And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones. Shristi 18:29 Hmm. So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers? P1 18:43 Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh. Shristi 18:49 OK. P1 18:52 OK. Can you guys hear me alright? Shristi 18:54 Yeah, we do. P1 18:56Uh, yeah. So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like. Can you give me links with pictures? So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing. But in other times. I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like speciﬁc models of backpacks within this brand and like speciﬁc colors. It then gave me speciﬁc models but not speciﬁc colors. Shristi 20:00 Umm. OK. Makes sense. So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the speciﬁc feature properly. P1 20:27 Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it. Shristi 20:50 OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it. P1 21:12 Umm. Shristi 21:14 So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard? P1 21:18 Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it. Shristi 21:48 Umm. P1 21:48 Uh, or like banter with it? And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one speciﬁcally, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out. Shristi 22:32 Oh really? P1 22:33 Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm. Shristi 22:43 Umm. P1 22:46 Umm. And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it. That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer. Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers. Shristi 23:07 Yeah. P1 23:11 Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing. Shristi 23:21 Yeah. P1 23:23 So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people. Shristi 23:28 OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it? P1 23:43 Umm, I would say no. Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny. But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing. Shristi 24:10Makes sense. Ohm so. So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone? P1 24:26 Umm. I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh. What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it. Shristi 25:28 Umm. P1 25:36 So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever. Shristi 25:36 Umm. P1 25:41 Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all. Shristi 25:45 Yeah, makes sense. P1 25:49 Yeah. Shristi 25:50 So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI? P1 26:04 No, I I don't think so. Shristi 26:07 Hmm, OK. So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI? P1 26:21 I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.Shristi 26:27 Umm so so. P1 26:28 Which is just, yeah. Shristi 26:30 Hmm. So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT. So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines? P1 26:49 Umm. I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example. Shristi 27:20 Mm-hmm. Umm. P1 27:29 Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others. Shristi 28:21 Umm. Umm yeah, sure. So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have? P1 28:40 I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm. I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure. Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need. And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not speciﬁcally asking likethe Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like. Shristi 29:51 Umm. OK. Makes sense. Umm. So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things? P1 30:08 Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this. Shristi 30:22 Umm. P1 30:31 Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere. Shristi 30:35 Umm. P1 30:36 Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different. Shristi 31:06 Yeah, I think that's that's fair. So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads? P1 31:19 Umm. Ohh no, I don't think so. Shristi 31:28 Ohh OK really OK. P1 31:30 Yeah. Shristi 31:32 Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding backand giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least. P1 31:48 Yeah. Shristi 31:49 And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat? P1 32:02 Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin. Shristi 32:10 OK. Yeah. P1 32:11 Yeah. Shristi 32:11 So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed. P1 32:15 It just knows, yeah. Shristi 32:17 Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then. OK, so so when you receive any recommendations. So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that? P1 32:42 Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way. Shristi 33:06 OK, makes sense. P1 33:08 Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.Shristi 33:29 Mm-hmm. P1 33:33 It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not. Shristi 33:45 Umm. Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you ﬁnish the conversation. P1 33:53 I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that. Shristi 34:11 Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry. P1 34:42 Uh, yeah. Shristi 34:42 Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reﬂect back on that experience a little bit for us? P1 34:53 Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to ﬂy? Shristi 35:15 This is. P1 35:20 And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke. Shristi 35:27 Umm. Yeah.P1 35:32 And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it. Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes? And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it. Shristi 36:11 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously. P1 36:22 Yeah. Shristi 36:24 Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you ﬁlters. P1 36:34 Ohh yeah. Shristi 36:34 Ohm, I'm so. So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us? P1 36:42 Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like. P1 36:56 Ask it to recommend a ﬁlter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and ﬁrst of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway. Shristi 37:00 Umm. Umm. P1 37:11 So I don't know what that was about. Shristi 37:15 OK.P1 37:16 But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a ﬁlter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat ﬁlter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the ﬁlter homepage. Shristi 37:45 Umm. P1 37:47 Of the camera like tab. Shristi 37:49 The where we where we take, where we take new snaps. P1 37:53 Yeah. Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the ﬁlters. Shristi 38:00 Umm. P1 38:00 It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that speciﬁc cat ﬁlter. Shristi 38:04 That OK. Umm, so. So when you were not able to reach the speciﬁc ﬁlter, how how did it make you feel at the time? P1 38:19 You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this ﬁlter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah. Shristi 38:45 Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right. P1 38:49 Yeah. Mm-hmm. Shristi 38:51 OK. Yeah, makes sense. OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more speciﬁc I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you ﬁnd the responses by MyAI? P1 39:17 Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual? Shristi 39:24 Yeah. In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes? P1 39:45 Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times. So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to. Shristi 40:11 Umm. P1 40:31 But I wouldn't take it at face value. Shristi 40:38 Yeah, right. P1 40:40 And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other? Shristi 41:01 Umm. P1 41:01 Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account? Does it know how expensive it is? Shristi 41:09 Umm. P1 41:11 Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?Shristi 41:15 Yeah. P1 41:16 It's like for like minute details. I I would do that research on my own. Shristi 41:23 Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with. P1 41:34 Basically, yeah. Shristi 41:35 Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those? P1 42:11 Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself? Shristi 42:37 I mean. P1 42:41 So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself. Shristi 42:52 Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reﬂecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for? P1 43:16 Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively. Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to ﬁgure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality orsomething to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future. Shristi 44:02 OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and. Kadir 44:05 I have a quick question. I have a quick question. P1 44:09 Yeah. Kadir 44:09 Just before ﬁnishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate. P1 44:24 Umm. Kadir 44:27 I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that? P1 44:54 Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference. Kadir 45:13 Umm. P1 45:13 Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human. And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even. Kadir 45:29 Hmm. P1 45:32 Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the SnapchatAI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT. Kadir 46:06 Umm. Shristi 46:12 No. Yeah. Kadir 46:14 Hmm. Hmm, yeah. Shristi 46:17 Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for speciﬁcally for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for? P1 46:37 Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned? Shristi 47:01 Umm. P1 47:01 I'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games. Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it. Shristi 47:09 Umm. P1 47:11 Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games. Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or. Shristi 47:28 Umm. P1 47:30 If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.Shristi 47:49 Umm. P1 47:59 So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case. Kadir 48:07 Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here. Shristi 48:14 Umm. Kadir 48:17 That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that? P1 48:47 Uh, could you say that again? So like uh? Kadir 48:51 Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings. P1 49:09 Yes. Kadir 49:26 As far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong. P1 49:27 Yes. Kadir 49:29 And how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI? P1 49:49Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine. Kadir 50:07 Mm-hmm. P1 50:08 That's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations. Kadir 50:13 Umm. P1 50:15 And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more. Kadir 50:29 Umm. P1 50:40 Or, uh, like like human? Like so. Kadir 50:46 Umm. P1 50:46 Like if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know. Like why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers. Kadir 50:54 Umm. Yeah. Thanks very much. P1 51:07 Yeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted. Kadir 51:13 Ohh wait, you're you're muted. Shristi 51:16 I do it all the time. I'm sorry.P1 51:18 Yeah, yeah. Shristi 51:19 So yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention? P1 51:30 No, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun. Thanks for inviting me to participate. Shristi 51:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Kadir 51:37 Deﬁnitely. Shristi 51:37 Yeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK Shristi stopped transcription\n"

      "['\\ufeffTranscript P2_Interview\\nMarch  18, 2024, 12:10AM\\n\\n\\nShristi started transcription\\n\\nKadir   0:15\\nOK, perfect. So.\\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself, if possible?\\n\\nP2   0:25\\nLittle about myself?\\nKadir   0:27\\nYes, yes.\\n\\nP2   0:27\\nOK, so I\\'m a graduate student here, here at the [a US university], and now graduating this year.\\nSo I\\'m doing my civil engineering masters in civil engineering with an emphasis on Geotechnical engineering. I think I have been using Snapchat for the past three years. If you want to know.\\n\\nKadir   0:50\\nWow. Past three years, it\\'s been quite a few kind of like experience probably it seems alright So then could you also tell me what social media platforms do you use other than, let\\'s say, in this case, Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   1:10\\nUh, so Instagram. Facebook, mostly on Instagram and mostly Instagram. Other than that, Facebook, sometimes with Twitter, and that\\'s all. If LinkedIn counts as social media, I did that while I was searching for jobs, but not anymore.\\n\\nKadir   1:28\\nSo we get an Instagram. Facebook OK. Yeah, that\\'s that\\'s fair. So. When when did you start using Snapchat? Uh.\\n\\nP2   1:46\\nSo yeah, it was like back and forth when I when I was back in [a South Asian Country]. So I usually use for like one month and then the not use that for like one year and then again come back.\\nBut after I came to US like it\\'s been like 2 years, most probably. So I\\'ve been like continuously using it for the past two years.I would say.\\n\\nKadir   2:05\\nNo. OK. So just. Is there any umm what makes a continuous use in the US for Snapchat?\\nIs there any kind of like reason for?\\n\\nP2   2:18\\nAnd now, and there\\'s not, not not this kind of disparity while competing with [a South Asian Country] and US, but just that when I am in the US, I could like connect with my friends, move through Snapchat with home in [a South Asian Country] So back back when I was in [a South Asian Country], I didn\\'t didn\\'t need to do that because I was actually there. So that makes it easy to like...\\n\\nKadir   2:36\\nOK, OK. Yeah.\\n\\nP2   2:37\\n..know what they\\'re doing like in their daily life. And like you know about their situations, where it\\'s pretty fun.\\n\\nKadir   2:43\\nYeah, I got it. That makes sense. That makes sense. I relate to that for sure.\\n\\nP2   2:49\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   2:50\\nWhat do you do most on on the on the Snapchat then could you tell us a little bit?\\n\\nP2   2:56\\nYeah. So. So I\\'m like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you\\'re doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it\\'s like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it\\'s kind of like to. So what you\\'re doing on a bit daily basis, so it\\'s kind of fun.\\n\\nKadir   3:28\\nOK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well.\\n\\nP2   3:32\\nYeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   3:45\\nOK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   4:02\\nUh, so when it was first released, I don\\'t know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don\\'t know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was first released, but to be honest, after that I haven\\'t really used this before this program or before your project.\\n\\nKadir   4:10\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:22\\nSo yeah, I don\\'t have very much experience than you guys as well, so.\\n\\nKadir   4:22\\nUmm.\\nYeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was.\\n\\nP2   4:32\\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here.\\n\\nKadir   4:35\\nYeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it?\\n\\nP2   4:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat field whenever you Instagram.\\n\\nKadir   4:44\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:45\\nSo it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven\\'t really used it.\\n\\nKadir   4:53\\nOK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature.\\n\\nP2   5:07\\nYeah. Yeah, I did.\\n\\nKadir   5:08\\nUh, yeah.\\n\\nP2   5:08\\nI did.\\n\\nKadir   5:09\\nSo then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn\\'t related to the study.\\n\\nP2   5:21\\nYeah. Yeah, I\\'m gonna. I\\'m going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you first was. What was the first task? If you can remind me.\\n\\nKadir   5:34\\nI think we asked you to have a travel recommendation.\\n\\nP2   5:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn\\'t think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days.\\nI have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the first answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary.\\n\\nKadir   5:58\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   6:03\\nIt give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing.\\nSo I..I was kind of like I didn\\'t check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing.\\n\\nKadir   6:20\\nOhh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details.\\n\\nP2   6:27\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   6:27\\nOK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that first task?\\n\\nP2   6:40\\nNo, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So first of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   6:59\\nOK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences.\\n\\nP2   7:16\\nMy prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the \"guess the country\\'s flag\" game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that\\'s all I have.\\n\\nKadir   7:34\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   7:36\\nIt\\'s like kind of. It\\'s not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it\\'s it\\'s kind of cool.\\n\\nKadir   7:47\\nYeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don\\'t know, like kill time at the time and then.\\n\\nP2   7:53\\nYou\\'re saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it.\\n\\nKadir   8:08\\nMm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience?\\n\\nP2   8:31\\nOK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I\\'m working on my thesis or something like that. So it\\'s really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that\\'s why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I\\'ve used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two.\\n\\nKadir   9:01\\nHmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations?\\n\\nP2   9:17\\nWith my expectations, OK, so.\\n\\nKadir   9:20\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   9:24\\nUmm. Let\\'s see. I\\'m gonna. I\\'m going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker.\\n\\nKadir   9:37\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   9:39\\nIt didn\\'t perform that well on this one. So I think the first the first tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me first suggestion on soccer cleats but didn\\'t like it, didn\\'t like provide like such great information on that.\\nAnd also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn\\'t recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period.\\nIt\\'s going like provide much information about there.\\nSo I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one.\\n\\nKadir   10:41\\nThe first one.\\n\\nP2   10:42\\nYeah. The first one was the. Yeah, it was the best one.\\n\\nKadir   10:46\\nThe the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it.\\n\\nP2   10:52\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.\\n\\nKadir   10:54\\nYeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember.\\n\\nP2   11:03\\nI..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nKadir   11:10\\nRocky mountains.\\n\\nP2   11:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:14\\nSo do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean?\\n\\nP2   11:20\\nThat\\'s where I would go. Yeah, absolutely.\\nI gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life.\\n\\nKadir   11:23\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   11:29\\nSo and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that\\'s a place where I would definitely go in the future, so.\\n\\nKadir   11:36\\nMaybe that\\'s why you it could be aligning. OK, OK.\\n\\nP2   11:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:40\\nI totally understand. Yeah. So then also, yeah. Can you share an experience where it didn\\'t meet your expectations? And then yeah, that would be nice.\\n\\nP2   11:50\\nNo. OK, OK. So let me go over the task with the shopping list, right? The..where you wanted to do like buy something.\\n\\nKadir   11:59\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   12:05\\nI really needed a new..\\n\\nKadir   12:06\\nYou wanted to buy, right?\\n\\nP2   12:08\\nYeah, I I needed a new soccer cleats right now, so I just try to like incorporate that in the task as well. So I asked him to like, suggest me some soccer cleats based on my position of play like soccer field. So I play midfielders generally, so I wanted something light and something that lasted me long because last soccer cleat that I bought was like only for three or four months.\\nIt suggested me like 2..2 of the like most famous soccer cleats, which were like all over the Internet as so. Yeah. And I asked like, it is a well out of my budget. So can you like say say something in between like 150 to $200.00 but it still gave me the same same two models that it showed me like previously and after that what I did was I asked for like the pictures.\\nLike the pictures, if if you provide like pictures from the Internet but no it it couldn\\'t provide that\\nSo I think that was the worst experience with me. So it\\'s sort of like a prompt insert a picture of [inaudible] within like big brackets. You can see in the screenshots so it was kind of like not that good.\\n\\nKadir   13:14\\nYeah. What was lacking in in that?\\n\\nP2   13:17\\nYeah. So I I I asked the picture of like 2 soccer cleats that it was trying to show me earlier and it couldn\\'t like provide me the picture and also the it couldn\\'t like uh what do you say..suggest the price..uh..the cleats within my budget so. It it only knew about like 2 soccer cleats and it kind of like repeatedly went on and went on about the same thing again and again even if you asked like different questions.\\n\\nKadir   13:46\\nUmm, so it was not.. OK. Yeah, I I I got it. Definitely. So, uh, how much effort was required to use MyAI chatbot in your experiences so far?\\n\\nP2   14:05\\nI guess it depends on like what kind of question you\\'re asking. So again, so the first task that I did was like pretty smooth and I got what was required within like 3 or 4 questions or prompts.\\nBut for the..as I have said like..\\n\\nKadir   14:17\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   14:21\\nThe soccer cleats one.. the shopping list and also the describe the picture or something like that. So it took like will more than like ten tries to get even get like close to it. So it was like stuck on one thing and it\\'s going to go like up from that. So even if I ask a lot of questions, so yeah, I think it depends on my experience. It depends on what you\\'re actually trying to ask out of the MyAI feature.\\n\\nKadir   14:46\\nOK. So then as far as I understand, do you mean, I mean it depends on the topic. It depends on.\\n\\nP2   14:53\\nYeah, yeah. It depends on the topic and how well known the topic is. I most probably because National parks are like more searched than football cleats..I guess..all over the Internet and yeah, I did ask it about like this dish from [a South Asian Country] during my photo.. Task with the photo uploading a picture and then asking about the picture.\\n\\nSo it couldn\\'t recognize that, and even if I like told it that it was like a dish from [a South Asian Country]. So it could not provide much information about that as well. So I think it depends on how what would people like asking the in the Internet more. So if you like talk about a least talked topic with the MyAI think it just like other time to like actually go into the topic you like you\\'ll be stuck somewhere around like in the first two or three replies and then if you like try to get more out of it..it will take some time on those kind of topics.\\n\\nKadir   15:28\\nOK. Umm. I I get it. Yeah. When it start then it\\'s it\\'s not maybe forwarding with the conversation, unfortunately.\\n\\nP2   16:01\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:02\\nOK. So, uh, uh, do you think any skills are needed? Uh, any any skills are needed to use MyAI chatbot well or effectively let\\'s say.\\n\\nP2   16:19\\nI think even like no basic English writing and reading then it would be enough. You doing anything so that you just need to know about the Snapchat interface interface and just the basic English that you do writing, typing, reading. So I think that that that\\'s enough.So I don\\'t think that\\'s like too much.\\n\\nKadir   16:37\\nUmm, so basically kind of English proficiency and then kind of writing, typing and you said writing typing.\\n\\nP2   16:43\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:45\\nI mean, do you think? By writing, is there any? Specific skills for.\\n\\nP2   16:55\\nAnd not have I just writing because like the way the AI AI reacts to your message like it largely or it mostly depends on your prompt right.\\nIf you like, try to get trying to get some information out of the MyAI but you are not like expressing yourself well in the prompt. So then it will like take wrong turn on like it will not understand what you\\'d like to say. So if you have like good understanding of English writing and reading and then a good understanding of Snapchat because you have to first of all go to MyAI to like type type it out. So if you have a good knowledge of that interface, then I think anyone can do this.\\n\\nKadir   17:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   17:32\\nAnyone, anyone can utilize this yeah.\\n\\nKadir   17:33\\nOK. OK. So just here I have one more follow up. So then do you think in terms of writing or typing? Different writing and prompting would would would differ. Do you think I mean how is your experience with that?\\n\\nP2   17:59\\nI think so. Yeah, I think like the way you write or like the way you present a prompt to an to MyAI. So it will definitely like the answer would be definitely different, so I don\\'t know how to fix it, but yeah, if you like, try a write a prompt in it like a detailed manner.\\n\\nKadir   18:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   18:15\\nSo you should like express all the things that you need to get out of my head. Sometimes it might work, but sometimes it can\\'t, like necessarily pushes all the information. I think like that.\\nSo that\\'s why I always like start with the small short short, short prompt and then try to go into deep into the conversation after it kind of like replies in a good way or replies in a good direction.\\n\\nKadir   18:32\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   18:37\\nSo if yeah.\\n\\nKadir   18:39\\nOK.\\nUmm.\\nAnd in your experiences during the diary study or prior, did you encounter any obstacles when using MyAI.\\n\\nP2   18:56\\nObstacles. And does advertisements count as obstacle? Because I received like a lot of that.\\n\\nKadir   19:03\\nHmm so.\\n\\nP2   19:05\\nYeah, they were like a lot of extra, but it\\'s advertisements which are not related to my prompts or anything like that. So this has been like annoying. Other than that, I don\\'t think so. I like a little bit of trouble uploading a picture. I don\\'t know why it like took a lot of long time. It took like about one minute to upload a picture, so I think those two are the major things that I did not like or would say obstacles while doing your the diary stories.\\n\\nKadir   19:27\\nMm-hmm. So what makes advertisements? Kind of like annoying for you. Or think you are that they are, they might be obstacle.\\n\\nP2   19:44\\nSo if if the advertisement are like what I\\'m looking for. So if I\\'m like if they are like what, how do I put it? So if I see a random advertisement on my screen, so it must be like something related to what I\\'m trying to say, right to MyAI.\\n\\nKadir   19:58\\nHearing me.\\n\\nP2   19:59\\nBut it is like some random kind of thing, like some magazine covers or something like that.\\nSo which I haven\\'t really talked about it with MyAI then I think that it\\'s like kind of annoying.\\n\\nKadir   20:11\\nOK, OK. Yeah, yeah, definitely. If if it\\'s not related to your purpose, I understand.\\n\\nP2   20:16\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   20:16\\nYep. Uh. So. Do you like? Do you feel like you have access to necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP2   20:29\\nYeah, I think so.\\n\\nKadir   20:31\\nOK. So that\\'s that\\'s fair enough. And have you heard somebody in your circle or environment else talk about MyAI before?\\n\\nP2   20:49\\nWhen, it like first came out. Yes, but after that I don\\'t think like anybody is using it would even though people using Snapchat. So when it first came out, like we were like, kind of, what do you say we were like, trying to see what that was? So it was introduced as your personal assistant on Snapchat first. So before MyAI, I think so it it was introduced as personal assistant.\\nSo I had like few talks with it and also some of my friends did as well. So yeah, but I don\\'t think it\\'s like that, that that used right now.\\n\\nKadir   21:18\\nAnd. OK so.\\n\\nP2   21:22\\nI can\\'t speak for all of all of us, but that\\'s what I think.\\n\\nKadir   21:27\\nOK, so it can be a friend. It can be an acquaintance or a media, so probably you\\'ve heard from friends when it came up first. As far as I understand.\\n\\nP2   21:36\\nYeah. Yeah, it\\'s gonna be your friend as well. So as I told you earlier, so when I was stuck once in the airport so I had nothing to do with having to talk with an AI. So yeah, it it did help me at that time. So it can be your friend.\\n\\nKadir   21:48\\nOK. OK.\\n\\nP2   21:49\\nYou\\'re gonna situation, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   21:51\\nYeah. So then yeah, it\\'s more like if you if you, I mean you said for example you might be considering it as a friend or maybe personal assistant. So does this affect anything or how does it, you know affect you communication with with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   22:17\\nSo if you\\'re like trying to like, uh, if you think of it as a friend, I think, and your prompt are what you type into the my hair would be like a lot of a lot friendly. So I think that\\'s the only thing.\\nSo what? What you consider it as if you like. Think of it like a search engine. Or like, uh, yeah, feature that will help you to get some information. So you are prompt would would would be formal and you would like have to like type it in a detail. But if you like using it for fun so it can be like short and like silly kind of prompts because you that depends on the intent of use right?\\n\\nKadir   22:51\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   22:53\\nSo I think there\\'s there\\'s the rest of the difference.\\n\\nKadir   22:57\\nOK. Yeah, so. Have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAI?\\n\\nP2   23:11\\nNo, not exactly MyAI, but like another a lot of other generative AI, so even my professor my advisor tells me to like properly use like ChatGPT or something like that. Other generative AI, but not exactly my Snapchat. Yeah, because I think the demographics are the people using my AI is like kind of like limited to teenagers right now. So they are not the guys who I would take advice with.\\n\\nKadir   23:32\\nUh-huh.\\n\\nP2   23:35\\nSo I think that that.\\n\\nKadir   23:37\\nWell, OK, OK, I got it.\\n\\nP2   23:38\\nWe could.\\n\\nKadir   23:41\\nSo would you recommend trying myAI to your friends?\\n\\nP2   23:49\\nYes, you\\'re I can do that.\\n\\nKadir   23:54\\nAnd why?\\n\\nP2   23:55\\nBut but according to the user\\'s there, according to the uses, if they want to like search for anything specific then I wouldn\\'t like tell them to go to go and search in MyAI because I don\\'t think like it\\'s like that effective.\\n\\nKadir   23:55\\nWhy would you?\\nWhy would you?\\n\\nP2   24:09\\nBut if they just want to have fun, I can like this. Suggest them this. Speak with MyAI in the future. It was one like I can say like that, but if they want like get some information out of MyAI, then I would not recommend it.\\n\\nKadir   24:22\\nOK, OK. And since starting using my I have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\\n\\nP2   24:34\\nNo, no, I I have noticed with I think it is just the same.\\n\\nKadir   24:35\\nGeneral social media habits, I mean. OK. Uh, do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to MyAI?\\n\\nP2   24:52\\nMy uh, yeah, I use like ChatGPT on a daily basis.\\n\\nKadir   24:57\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   24:57\\nAll the other than that, I don\\'t think I have like much explicit experience with other generative AI apps or some like that. I think that ChatGPT is the only one.\\n\\nKadir   25:07\\nOK. Yeah. I asked this but still I wanna ask. Maybe a kind of follow up. What is similar between chat GPT and MyAI or? And what is different in essence?\\n\\nP2   25:25\\nOK. So in essence, OK, so the I think what I feel is like ChatGPT, if you like ask any questions.\\nSo it will like generally it will respond in like formal matters like and I use it like more more for like formal things. So if I have to write to mail and I want to like make like make it like good I ask such as visual change the mail and change the mail to a better format. And if I\\'m writing a document and I think that my English is a little bit bad, then I asked the charge to change it into kind of like formal or like more scientific terms or write in a better way or for clarity or something like that. So I think it\\'s like more more used in like office kind of work with ChatGPT.\\nUh, for me personally, so actually use this during my thesis.. so during my thesis.\\n\\nI use this use this a lot but MyAI I think it\\'s just like as I said earlier. So I we can use it as a friend.\\nSo if I you don\\'t need to be like that formal it doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t become that formal with you in the responses, so it\\'s like kind of like friendly chat I felt. So yeah, I think the main difference between that is like my uses, it depends on my users as well.\\n\\nKadir   26:33\\nHmm.\\n\\nP2   26:39\\nSo I use my.\\n\\nKadir   26:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   26:41\\nI use ChatGPT for like a lot of things in my work, but yeah, MyAI not that much.\\n\\nKadir   26:45\\nHmm.\\nUmm uh, yeah, I think this is this is pretty helpful. So I remember you also were telling about you use ChatGPT on your desktop and then MyAI on your phone so.\\n\\nP2   27:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   27:05\\nOther than kind of like categorizing you said ChatGPT, for more formal stuff for more. Maybe professional stuff versus check MyAI, more personal, maybe more lightweight.\\n\\nP2   27:16\\nYes. Yeah.\\n\\nKadir   27:17\\nSo what characteristics? What characteristics of MyAI leads to that kind of like perception or perspective for you?\\n\\nP2   27:32\\nUh, so yeah, if you like, look at some of the things, some of the screenshots. So the way that MyAI reply is, so it\\'s like pretty like informal, if you see uses like worse like oops, my bad something like that.\\n\\nKadir   27:42\\nUh.\\n\\nP2   27:46\\nSo the things that you use and in like daily conversation with the friends and all so and it it is like kind of like what do you say expressive of its emotion? I think so because like it it kind of like if I tell it that it is wrong, then it says like, oops, I\\'m..I\\'m so sorry for that. Something like that.\\n\\nKadir   28:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   28:04\\nWe don\\'t see in terms if you did that often, so eventually like give a prompt, then it will just say something formally. So I think this is the main reason why is why I said so.\\n\\nKadir   28:14\\nMore conversational features of language. Uh.\\n\\nP2   28:18\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   28:19\\nSupposed in my AI any have you? I don\\'t know. Like would you like to eligible bit comment on any. Like interface features like any features that MyAI has, make it more personal or versus impersonal.\\n\\nP2   28:39\\nInterface features. Uh, I think it\\'s just like chatting with a friend right in MyAI. So if you if you have seen the interface of my AI so it\\'s like exactly the same as like other Snapchat chats.\\n\\nKadir   28:47\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   28:56\\nAnd so it has like a place to, like, upload your pictures or something like that. Send a sticker, sticker or even like voice memos, which you don\\'t see in ChatGPT.\\n\\nKadir   29:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   29:04\\nSo yeah, I think that all the interface is is it is like making it is like designed to be like your personal friend or assistant like that\\'s what I feel.\\n\\nKadir   29:15\\nOK. OK, definitely indefinitely. That makes sense. So I think you said this, you saw some ads or sponsored content while interacting with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   29:30\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nKadir   29:30\\nAnd then you\\'re feeling was OK. I\\'m skipping this question because you already kind of responded to that, sorry. So in terms of in your conversation with my I, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP2   29:51\\nReliable.\\n\\nKadir   29:52\\nYeah. Do you think the responses from my AI have reliable they are.\\n\\nP2   29:57\\nSo far I don\\'t think I can see that I can answer this question right now because I haven\\'t like cross checked, but it uh answered me because I actually to like give me an itinerary with all the pricing and the budgeting. But I haven\\'t like looked into how accurate that was really. But I know from the fact that it gave me like wrong information on the soccer fields, so I would say not that reliable.\\n\\nKadir   30:21\\nHmm. Yeah. With soccer cleats I? When I looked at your screenshots, umm for all the options it was offering giving the same price right?\\n\\nP2   30:33\\nYeah, I I told it like it. My budget is like $150.00 and give me a price range for all of the soccer cleats, but I think it it all showed the same pricing like $150.00 for everything yeah.\\n\\nKadir   30:47\\nAnd then it\\'s kind of like a question mark, I I see, like I, yeah, so you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI, for example, I\\'ve seen a you you share your picture with the chat, but what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by MyAI on Snapchat or by Snapchat let\\'s say?\\n\\nP2   30:49\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, I I couldn\\'t get the last part like that. Good. Can you like repeat that again?\\n\\nKadir   31:20\\nSure you shared. Let me quickly be we\\'re waiting. You might have shared something personal when interacting with the my AI chat bot and what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by Snapchat.\\n\\nP2   31:38\\nUsed by Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   31:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   31:42\\nI don\\'t think I have, like, ever thought of thought it. So what I think what do you want me to say in that regard? If my information or like pictures are used by the Snapchat itself, the Snapchat app or like my AI in a different way, is like going to be what you say public on the Internet or something like that. I couldn\\'t get the question completely so.\\n\\nKadir   32:08\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   32:41\\nOK, it\\'s alright. Yeah, I\\'m not that concerned because all everything like you say right now or in the modern day world like they know it all, I think so they can like hear us like through our phones. And so if you look at the ads given by Facebook is like kind of even if I speak in [home country language] with my friend, it kind of latches onto that and shows me the air of the same thing in Facebook.\\n\\nKadir   33:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   33:11\\nSo I think our data is being like sold everywhere right now. So I I don\\'t mind. I don\\'t mind it.\\nI..I\\'m not that concerned about it.\\n\\nKadir   33:26\\nOK, I think I this is totally fair. I think this kind of brings us to the end of our conversation. Do you have anything at the very end to add or to emphasize before we hung up?\\n\\nP2   33:44\\nNo, not really. \\n\\nP2   35:08\\nNice to meet you, buddy.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   35:11\\nOK, I\\'ll stop the recording.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nNice to meet you too.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\\n', \"\\ufeffTranscript P3_Interview\\nMarch 21, 2024\\n\\nShristi started transcription\\n\\nKadir  0:12\\nOK, perfect.\\nSo let's start then.\\nThe recording has started.\\nCan you tell me a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP3   0:26\\nYeah.\\nSo my my full name is [P3].\\nI'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally.\\n\\nKadir  0:46\\nOK.\\nOK, senior in microbiology and genetics.\\n\\nP3   0:49\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir  0:50\\nOK and.\\nWhat social media platforms do you use?\\n\\nP3   0:58\\nOhm.\\nMore often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  1:06\\nIt's not OK.\\nAnd when did you start using Snapchat?\\n\\nP3   1:18\\nOoh, I wanna say.\\n8-8 years ago or maybe 9?\\n\\nKadir  1:27\\nEight or nine years ago.\\n\\nP3   1:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  1:28\\nOK.\\nOK, that's good to know.\\nUmm.\\nAnd then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general?\\n\\nP3   1:40\\nOhm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir  1:51\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   1:51\\nSo yeah, just chatting with friends.\\n\\nKadir  1:55\\nFriends.\\nOK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them.\\n\\nP3   1:59\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:01\\nOK.\\nOK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes.\\nGot it.\\n\\nP3   2:09\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  2:09\\nSo and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature?\\n\\nP3   2:21\\nUmm.\\nI wanna say, well, when did it do?\\nYou know when it began.\\n\\nKadir  2:29\\nI.\\n\\nShristi   2:30\\nI think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   2:32\\nA year ago.\\nOK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  2:38\\nUmm, when it first launched you either did it and then did.\\n\\nP3   2:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:43\\nDid you use?\\nSince then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time.\\n\\nP3   2:52\\nI used it when it first came out and then I didn't.\\nI guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again.\\n\\nKadir  3:01\\nOK.\\nThat's fair and OK, so.\\n\\nP3   3:03\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  3:08\\nJust uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago.\\nSo can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?\\nUmm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.\\nJust a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.\\n\\nP3   3:44\\nYeah, I like.\\nSo with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.\\nThings to see in a specific place.\\nSo if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.\\nWhat places can I see or what places can I eat?\\nAnd I like some of the suggestions that it gives.\\n\\nKadir  4:05\\nHmm.\\nSo mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions.\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   4:10\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  4:10\\nYeah.\\nSo make sense so.\\nDo you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those?\\nRecommendations for eating out or for a place to visit?\\n\\nP3   4:31\\nYeah.\\nSo when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.\\nSo then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.\\n\\nKadir  4:50\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   4:52\\nSo I liked that it kept that in mind.\\n\\nKadir  4:54\\nOK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?\\n\\nP3   5:08\\nUh.\\nOK, so if I were to put it on a scale of.\\n\\nKadir  5:15\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   5:16\\nI don't know one to five.\\nI guess I would say.\\n2 1/2.\\n\\nKadir  5:24\\nOK, in the middle. Mediocre.\\n\\nP3   5:25\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  5:28\\nOK.\\nIs there any?\\n\\nP3   5:32\\nReason.\\n\\nKadir  5:33\\nReason that led to this rating.\\n\\nP3   5:41\\nI just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.\\n\\nKadir  5:48\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   5:48\\nIf I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.\\n\\nKadir  6:10\\nHmm. Uh, OK, but.\\n\\nP3   6:16\\nSo I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.\\n\\nKadir  6:42\\nOh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?\\n\\nP3   6:59\\nUmm. Sorry, let me think.\\n\\nKadir  7:13\\nYes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.\\n\\nP3   7:24\\nUmm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.\\nI didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.\\n\\nKadir  7:45\\nUmm. Umm.\\n\\nP3   7:49\\nOtherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.\\n\\nShristi   8:14\\nIf it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff.\\n\\nP3   8:21\\nYeah, that helps.\\n\\nShristi   8:26\\nYeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like.\\n\\nP3   8:31\\nOK Ohh now I remember.\\nOK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.\\n\\nKadir  9:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   9:01\\nSo I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that.\\n\\nKadir  9:09\\nOK, OK. Yeah. Standing so. How much effort was required to use my AI chatbot? Uh. During your experiences?\\n\\nP3   9:27\\nUmm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about.\\nTo being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.\\nUmm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.\\n\\nKadir  10:05\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   10:07\\nBut yeah, I would say so.\\n\\nKadir  10:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   10:11\\nA little bit of effort, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  10:14\\nNot much, OK. OK. Umm do you think? If any special skills are needed to use my AI chatbot well.\\n\\nP3   10:35\\nUmm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  10:45\\nHmm.\\nIf I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]?\\nCan, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want.\\nSo and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require?\\n\\nP3   11:18\\nUmm, so could you repeat that question?\\n\\nKadir  11:23\\nI'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question.\\nYou said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want.\\nAnd was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?\\n\\nP3   11:48\\nOhh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it.\\n\\nKadir  12:05\\nUmm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI?\\n\\nP3   12:24\\nUmm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK.\\n\\nKadir  12:45\\nRight. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK.\\n\\nP3   12:55\\nYeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant.\\n\\nKadir  13:17\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   13:17\\nAnd I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine.\\nAnd then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad.\\nIt was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but.\\n\\nKadir  13:38\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   13:38\\nBut I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice.\\n\\nKadir  13:46\\nUmm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   13:59\\nOhh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out.\\nCould you repeat that?\\n\\nKadir  14:07\\nSure.\\nDo you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   14:21\\nOhm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:31\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   14:35\\nBut if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:44\\nOK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else?\\n\\nP3   15:04\\nOhm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture.\\nI don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  15:39\\nMm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that.\\n\\nP3   15:53\\nYeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.\\n \\nKadir  16:02\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   16:02\\nUmm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation.\\n\\nKadir  16:12\\nUmm.\\nHmm.\\nIt seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human.\\nUh. Features.\\n\\nP3   16:32\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  16:35\\nOK.\\nU], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII?\\n\\nP3   16:46\\nOhm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI.\\nSo then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you?\\n\\nKadir  17:02\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   17:08\\nI don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do.\\nAnd I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that.\\n\\nKadir  17:21\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   17:25\\nWhen it first came out.\\n\\nKadir  17:27\\nOK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms.\\n\\nP3   17:37\\nYeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it.\\n\\nKadir  17:57\\nOK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm.\\nOn on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study.\\n\\nP3   18:20\\nI feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically.\\n\\nKadir  18:53\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   18:55\\nI think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very.\\nHow do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more.\\n\\nKadir  19:29\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   19:38\\nSo it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.\\n\\nKadir  19:46\\nOK, OK.\\nUmm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:09\\nGonna say that hasn't really changed.\\n\\nKadir  20:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:13\\nHow are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could.\\n\\nKadir  20:19\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:28\\nIt could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  20:40\\nOK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:54\\nUmm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know.\\n\\nKadir  20:59\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   21:04\\nLike if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand.\\n\\nKadir  21:13\\nMm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity or difference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT.\\n\\nP3   21:43\\nI guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that.\\n\\nKadir  22:33\\nUmm. Hmm. OK.\\nUmm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with.\\nUmm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your?\\nPrompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them?\\n\\nP3   23:09\\nOh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah.\\n\\nKadir  23:12\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   23:15\\nI felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary.\\n\\nKadir  23:26\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   23:31\\nUmm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time.\\n\\nKadir  23:41\\nSo it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a.\\n\\nP3   23:46\\nUmhm.\\n\\nKadir  23:47\\nSo you can't make it on and off.\\n\\nP3   23:51\\nOh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off?\\n\\nKadir  23:55\\nI don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either.\\n\\nP3   23:57\\nOhh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links.\\nI might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would.\\n\\nKadir  24:07\\nWhat?\\n\\nP3   24:07\\nIt would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:28\\nOK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it?\\nCan I quickly ask?\\n\\nP3   24:41\\nOh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:44\\nYeah.\\nOr you said you were watching it, right?\\n\\nP3   24:47\\nOh, oh, no, no.\\nI was just, uh, I just said Ohh.\\nI think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip and then that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after.\\n\\nKadir  24:54\\nYeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements.\\nAlso, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very?\\nGeneric.\\n\\nP3   25:27\\nI think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about.\\n\\nKadir  25:33\\nUmm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses?\\n\\nP3   25:49\\nWell, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses.\\n\\nKadir  26:02\\nDid you? Yeah.\\n\\nP3   26:02\\nSo I I feel like it's probably 50-50.\\n\\nKadir  26:06\\nHmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers.\\n\\nP3   26:26\\nUmm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists.\\n\\nKadir  26:39\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   26:43\\nBut yeah, that that's all I really had the chance to look at.\\n\\nKadir  26:48\\nAnd then what was your shopping experience by the way, can you remind that to us? Shopping task.\\n\\nP3   26:55\\nYeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for.\\n\\nKadir  27:08\\nRight.\\n\\nP3   27:09\\nI don't know places that I had really good deals.\\n\\nKadir  27:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   27:15\\nAnd it was giving me.\\n\\nKadir  27:15\\nOr yeah, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:17\\nOhh sorry what?\\n\\nKadir  27:19\\nStores,. You mean?\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   27:20\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:20\\nI just remember, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:22\\nYeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person.\\n\\nKadir  27:35\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   27:35\\nOne of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:43\\nOK.\\nOK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform?\\n\\nP3   28:15\\nUmm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached.\\nI don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it.\\n\\nKadir  28:41\\nHmm.\\nOK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense.\\nUmm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly?\\n\\nP3   29:05\\nOhm.\\nI guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries.\\nEven if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.\\n\\nKadir  29:57\\nOK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more.\\n\\nP3   29:59\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  30:02\\nOK.\\nYeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again.\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for attending us.\\nI don't know if should see as a question or not, but.\\n\\nShristi   30:15\\nUmm I I have a few more questions.\\nI'll just go ahead and ask your.\\nSo do you see just to reel back a little bit?\\n\\nP3   30:20\\nOK.\\n\\nShristi   30:25\\nSo I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries.\\n\\nP3   30:47\\nOhh yeah.\\n\\nShristi   30:51\\nAnd then? You asked it.\\nHey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right?\\nAnd then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it.\\nAnd then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think.\\nAnd it said, hey, what else is going on?\\nAre there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshots after that?\\nSo did you, like, continue the conversation after that?\\nDo you remember anything from that day regarding it?\\n\\nP3   31:24\\nOhh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that?\\n\\nShristi   31:42\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   31:43\\nSo I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like.\\n\\nShristi   31:44\\nOK.\\nHmm.\\nOK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new?\\nConversation starters.\\nUh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it.\\nSo how do you feel about that interaction in general?\\n\\nP3   32:15\\nUh.\\nI feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm.\\nAnd when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person.\\n\\nShristi   32:51\\nUmm OK.\\n\\nP3   32:52\\nSo it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer.\\n\\nShristi   32:57\\nUmm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or five different things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for.\\n\\nP3   33:36\\nI want to say it's good for.\\nI mean, I keep bringing this up, but.\\nSince I like food, I like exploring new food places.\\nI like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even?\\nUmm definitely.\\nWhen I've tried to talk to ChatGPT.\\nYeah, it's just kind of curves me.\\nIt's like, OK, ask me the question now.\\nAnd even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue.\\nHaving a conversation with you as long as you wanted to.\\nUmm. What?\\nIt's bad for though.\\nI'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate.\\nIf that mean it's even less accurate, there we go.\\nIn a lot of a lot of things.\\nSo I think that's what it's bad that.\\n\\nShristi   34:46\\nMm-hmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOhm.\\nSo I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left.\\nI guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK.\\nSo final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly?\\n\\nP3   35:41\\nI wish there was.\\nI don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.\\nI don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for.\\nIt's just.\\nI just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but.\\nBecause I I still didn't even know what it was for.\\nReally, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for.\\nMaybe.\\nBut even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for.\\nIf it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources.\\n\\nShristi   36:29\\nHmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOK, I think that's all I had.\\nSo thank you so much.\\nI'll.\\nI'll pass it back to Kadir.\\nWhere you left it off.\\n\\nKadir  36:45\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for.\\nYeah.\\nHating in our diary study.\\nAnd so at the same time, and enjoy.\\nUh, Daisy.\\nUh, let's just kind of like is our session very much.\\nWould you like to right now?\\n\\nP3   37:11\\nOh wait, sorry.\\nDid you say something like?\\nAre you asking me a question?\\n\\nKadir  37:14\\nI'm just saying, are we?\\nAre we able to right now end the conversation the interview?\\n\\nP3   37:20\\nOh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nVery good.\\n\\nKadir  37:29\\nBye, bye.\\n\\nP3   37:30\\nGoodbye.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\\n\", \"\\ufeffTranscript P5_Interview\\nMarch  27, 2024\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:05\\nCan you please tell me a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP5 0:19\\nUh, so I'm P5. I'm from Nepal and I'm currently a freshman here in ISU from Biology department.\\n\\nShristi 0:27\\nSo can you tell me what social media platforms you use currently?\\n\\nP5 0:36\\nI use a lot of social media platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok\\n\\nShristi 0:46\\nSo do you remember when you did you start using Snapchat?\\n\\nP5 0:51\\nYeah. And that was really long ago, I think. I think I started using it since like 2017 or 18.\\n\\nShristi 1:00\\nSo maybe when you were a high schooler, high schooler?\\n\\nP5 1:04\\nNo. When I was in Grade 7 or 8.\\n\\nShristi 1:06\\nOh, so you were in in middle school?\\n\\nP5 1:08\\nYeah, but like I didn't not use it to interact with people, but just to like take snaps and like picture.\\n\\nShristi 1:15\\nOhh I know for the filters.\\n\\nP5 1:18\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi 1:18\\nYeah. Interesting. Yeah, I used to do that too when I was in.\\n\\nP5 1:21\\nYeah, I did that.I just started using it for like interacting with people since I was in grade 11.\\n\\nShristi 1:28\\nOhh great 11. That's interesting. Yeah, I really used to like some filters on Instagram.\\n\\nP5 1:34\\nYeah.The one with the flowers and it.\\n\\nShristi 1:37\\nOhh yeah, I know what you mean.\\n\\nShristi 1:37\\nOK, so currently, what do you do the most on in on Snapchat?\\n\\nP5 1:47\\nUmm, so I love taking snaps. I love taking pictures and the filters are like so good nowadays.And the other thing is I love to maintain streaks with my friends. So if this streaks is gonna like end, I'm gonna like call him or text him saying have and I. And I. Sometimes I talk to them like it's private, so I think I use the Snapchat for more personal and private conversations because it just like goes away in a day.\\n\\nShristi 2:18\\nYeah, makes sense. Did you use the Snapchat in my AI feature before this study?\\n\\nP5 2:30\\nYeah, I did.\\n\\nShristi 2:31\\nOK. So can you tell me when and why you started using it in the past?\\n\\nP5 2:36\\nOh, I don't know. I just like it was new to me. I didn't know it existed, but like it one day it suddenly appeared. So I was just like watching Tik Toks and like people were sharing screenshots about what they're talking and I wanted to try it. So I just like started talking to it and I don't know, I wanted to try if it knows various languages. So I started talking to the AI in Nepali and it did know Nepali language. I just.had fun. I used to like say so random things to the AI and it yeah, it just used to respond. I loved it.\\n\\nShristi 3:19\\nSo can you give me an example of how you have used this feature my AI? It can be an example from the study or it can be something outside of it.\\n\\nP5 3:32\\nUmm, I think I use it when I need like recommendations. When I'm going to a new place and I don't know what I'm gonna do, like if I'm hungry or something and I don't know where to eat, I just open Snapchat and ask it like, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 3:38\\nOK, so do you also use the recommendation that it makes?\\n\\nP5 3:55\\nYeah, I do. It sends me like four or five recommendations. So I check the all of them and then I just go to some place with higher reviews.\\n\\nShristi 4:07\\nUmm so. How frequently do you think you have used my AI? Have you used it multiple times or have you tried it like once or twice?\\n\\nP5 4:21\\nUh, when it first came, I used to like talk to almost like, twice or thrice a week, whenever I feel felt bored. But now I don't use it much because I don't have time. \\n\\nShristi 4:49\\nI think you have found my AI useful for recommendations. So is there anything else you have found my AI useful for?\\n\\nP5 4:55\\nUh, I think when I really do like vent something when I'm mad or like when I'm sad about something and I don't wanna talk to it about anyone else, I just try to talk to the AI because obviously it doesn't, you know, like it doesn't share my information to anybody and all. So when I do that I I think I like it because it it sends me like so many positive messages which I think helps me to cheer up my mood.\\n\\nShristi 5:24\\nUmm, yeah, yeah, I think I could get where you're coming from? Because I think if you talk about it, you share it with something. So it's just you talking to the AI. I think the will go away after a while, so I think it's more.\\n\\nP5 5:41\\nAnd also when I'm like not feeling pretty, I just what I do is I just send my snap or like a picture to the AI and it's like you're so pretty. You're you're looking amazing and all. And I feel good. So yeah.\\n\\nShristi 5:57\\nHmm you like the AI hyping you off. \\n\\nP5 5:59\\nYeah, I like it.\\n\\nShristi 6:00\\nCan you share me an experience where you found that my AI met your expectations?\\n\\nP5 6:17\\nI think it actually like does meet my expectations, like all the time, because when I really need a recommendation, when I really need to know what things I need to do here. Like if I don't know anything about a place or or if I don't know anything about a certain food, whether I should like, try it or not, then when I asked the AI it just like gives everything. What I need to know, so I think it does like carry out on my like expectations so.\\n\\nShristi 6:51\\nOK, sounds good. So can you share me an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations?\\n\\nP5 7:02\\nOhh that was when I that was like before this study. I think I was back in Nepal at that time and I needed to like go to someplace new in Kathmandu itself. But when I asked the AI about it, it was showing me exact same thing like all the time. It was showing me like four or five places. But I actually needed to know new places, but it was just showing me the common ones [in Kathmandhu]. I already knew about it. I already went there.I didn't like it wanted to tell me those things.\\n\\nShristi 7:42\\nUh, so I think it was just repeating the same five places that everybody knows about in Kathmandu..\\n\\nP5 7:50\\nYeah, it was just repeating all the time.\\n\\nShristi 7:52\\nSo your intention, I think for asking that would be finding new places that maybe you know like it's not known by everybody.\\n\\nP5 7:57\\nYeah, like if I ask it for the first time and it shows something, uh, I don't want it to show the same thing the second time or the third time.\\n\\nShristi 8:13\\nI know what you mean because like if it shows if you're telling it to do something new and if it's throwing you the same thing and you will get, yeah, it can get frustrating.\\n\\n\\nShristi 8:21\\nThank you for sharing that. So in general, because I think you have used my AI for quite a long time and I think you use it regularly, even outside of the study. So in your opinion, how much effort do you think using my AI needs?\\n\\nP5 8:43\\nI don't think it needs much effort because you can just steal it like anything you wanted. It understands, but sometimes what it does is you're talking about a certain topic and and you know, like if I ask if I'm asking you about something and it says another thing and I am asking the about the same topic but a different thing like a different thing about the exact same topic that we were talking about before. What it does is it like suddenly changes the topic.\\n\\nShristi 9:17\\nUmm, I think you know what you mean. I think one of the screenshots that you have uploaded when you were playing the game with it. So you go off to a tangent and talk about something else and you want to complete the game with it has forgotten about it, uh.\\n\\nP5 9;24\\nYeah, it just like completely jumps off to another topic and it's hard. Like I don't wanna explain something again and again to it like I it's. I don't like typing. I don't even like send text to my parents because I don't like typing at all.But when it does that, it just gets frustrating because I don't wanna explain it to like explain the same thing again and again.\\n\\nShristi 9:54\\nYeah, makes sense. So in terms of any skill set that is required to use my AI well, do you think there are any skills that are needed?\\n\\nP5 10:07\\nI don't think it's that important, but I think you need to like know how to actually carry on the conversation like you need to know what you're talking about, because it might suddenly change the topics and it might give you some advices which are not related to it. And if you don't know what you're talking about, it might take a completely different turn.\\n\\nShristi 10:36\\nUmm, so it's it's more about OK how do you post the questions and how do you reply to it?\\n\\nP5 10:45\\nYep. And sometimes it is like if the structure of the sentence doesn't like match to what you're trying to say, it just answers you about like completely different thing.\\n\\nShristi 11:00\\nSo. I'm taking it as is, you know, like you should have like basic English writing skills. It understands you well.\\n\\nP5 11:11\\nYou should have the knowledge of grammars.\\n\\nShristi 11:13\\nMakes sense. OK, so for using the my AI chat bot will do you think you have the necessary skills or know-how on how to get get it to. So do you have the skills or know-how to make it work well?\\n\\nP5 11:42\\nYeah, I think I do. I usually talk a lot, like even to people, so I don't think it's hard for me to talk to the AI because when  I open Snapchat and I decide to talk to the AI, I pretty much know what I want to talk about and what answers I want. So even if it answers me wrong or like even if it tells me about something else, I just tell it like, no, I don't mean this. I want to know about something else and you're wrong. So I think after that it gives me the answer that I want.\\n\\nShristi 12:18\\nOK, so you're usually not dropping the conversation, but you are just giving it enough context to give you the right answers.\\n\\nP5 12:26\\nYeah. I just asked something which I want to know about like except the recommendations things for recommendation. I don't know about anything, so I just ask it, but for other things I think I just ask it what I want to know. Like I want the confirmation that what I'm doing is right.\\n\\nShristi 12:48\\nUmm, so I think you talked about one obstacle already, which is it forgetting about what conversation you were having and going somewhere else. But apart from that, do you have you found other obstacles when you were trying to talk with my AI?\\n\\nP5 13:07\\nI don't think there are much obstacles. Yeah, I remember one thing. So whenever like I talked to him, I I talked to AI about something. It just sends me a paragraph like a whole paragraph. It's like 5-6 sentences and that's like I don't wanna read it like I just want one sentence. I just want a clear answer and it sends me so much I think, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 13;37\\nOh yeah, I know what you mean, because I think it on the phone, it looks very difficult to reed when they have like a para.\\n\\nP5 13:44\\nYeah, not like, very difficult, but even if it's like short things, even if it's two sentences or three sentences, it looks like a big paragraph in the phone because they screen is small. So it looks quite like intermediating to even read it because it looks so big. I don't wanna read it. I hate reading stuff and I like it.\\n\\nShristi 14:07\\nThat totally makes sense. Yeah, I do remember one other thing that happened with you. I think in the shopping task where you asked, I think something about iPhone 15 and it said it didn't exist. So what do you think about that?\\n\\nP5 14:20\\nI didn't know that it didn't know because I thought it's like computer viz. So like it has to have every single information like every new information, right? So I thought it knew already, but when I asked about it, it was like it hasn't even released it and I was like, what do you mean? They're gonna release iphone 16! I was shocked that it didn't know.\\n\\nShristi 14:46\\nOK, so when when that happened, do you like, did you like tell it that? Ohh, they're releasing it? Or or did you just like drop the conversation?\\n\\nP5 14:57\\nI I didn't ask it because at that time I was like, so sleepy. I didn't wanna like talk. I didn't wanna send anything else, like I didn't want to hold on the conversation for too long, and I knew if I did that, if I asked that question, it was gonna be long. So I didn't ask about it. Yeah, I didn't wanna explain.\\n\\nShristi 15:13\\nOK, so you didn't wanna take the trouble of explaining and and uh, OK, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 15:19\\nYeah, I didn`t wanna explain. \\n\\nShristi 15:22\\nUM and four UM, I think just as you said, there are some times when problems arise when you're using it, it forgets the conversation or it does not have the details. Or sometimes it might give the you know wrong information, so when that happens, do you feel you have access to any necessary resources or support to use it properly?\\n\\nP5 15:36\\nSo like in the MyAI, like in the Snapchat itself or outside it?\\n\\nShristi 15:40\\nIn the Snapchat itself or or somewhere outside where you can look up information.\\n\\nP5 15:44\\nUmm, I think it like when it does that. I think I go directly to Google and ask it, but sometimes when I ask the AI about the same thing like the thing that it got wrong, I think it like apologizes and says like I'm gonna search for it again and it sends me the correct information in third time or something. But I like to. I like to go to Google and search it because I don't trust it.\\n\\nShristi 16:17\\nSo I think you've already umm, I think touched on it a little bit that you saw TikToks  about, you know, people talking with my AI when it first came out. So in addition to the TikToks, have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet.\\n\\nP5 16:41\\nYeah, I have. I think my most of my friends use it sometimes, like not regularly but sometimes and before I told them they didn't actually use it. But when I told them that it also knows other languages and if you want to talk, talk to the AI in your own language, I think you can do it so like they tried it and they loved it too, like when we're bored or something like that. We just go to AI and ask those stupid things.\\n\\nShristi\\nSo so for the AI, have you for the AI, I think yes, you encouraged other people, but have you ever been encouraged by other people to use my AI? Or it could be something that other people posted. What did you use end up using my AI because of the Tik Toks?\\n.\\nP5 17:06\\nYeah, like nobody particularly told me to use it. I just used it because I saw some videos and it looked like fun, so yeah.\\n\\nShristi 17:46\\nSo for you are so because I think you have been using it for a certain period of time already. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habit after you started using my AI?\\n\\nP5 18:07\\nUh, not much, but I think when I because now I haven't, like, used it as much as I did before. I don't have free time, but I still use other social media so I don't know it just when I just talked to my AI it makes me forget about other things. So I just keep using the AI and then I sleep on time. So I like that about it. I think yeah, it just makes me forget about everything. Everything else does not know the Instagram, the Facebook and everything else. I just forget that they exist.\\n\\nShristi 18:49\\nUmm, so it's more like you know when you're trying to sleep, but you still wanna like scroll through the feeds or talk to other people. It's it's something that you talk to instead of doing other things so that you can slowly fall asleep. Is that what you're saying?\\n\\nP5 19:03\\nYeah. Yeah, sometimes I do that because talking to my AI is like sometimes it's boring. So if if I ask about some educational things or something to it, it start explaining everything and I feel so bored. I just. I just think no, I'd rather sleep. So I just like close my phone and I sleep.\\n\\nShristi 19:25\\nThat's that's, I think the most creative thing I've heard trying to sleep trying to get help for sleeping with my. That's cool.\\n\\nP5 19:35\\nBecause I can. I can literally not sleep. I tried everything. If I start scrolling, I just keep scrolling it until it's two or three, and even when I try to sleep, uh, with some music on, I started dancing. So I'd rather use that. I just could not sleep with music on so.\\n\\nShristi 20:03\\nOK, I I know what you mean because I think because for some people try to put music on and then just dose off. But then you love the music so much that you just going along with the songs.\\n\\nP5 20:13\\nYeah, like I. Also, because like I normally don't do music I I don't listen to music all the time. But when I do listen to music, I just love listening to it and I keep listening to it unless I cannot. So I just cannot sleep and yeah, and when I when I try to learn about some educational things, I just fell asleep. Like I don't want to study so definitely I feel I feel sleepy and then I just decide. No, I'd rather sleep.\\n\\nShristi 20:46\\nSo have you been using or have used in the past something that is similar to my AI?\\n\\nP5 20:56\\nThere's like ChatGPT. Makes sense?\\n\\nShristi 21:02\\nYeah, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 21:04\\nI've used that I've used that. I use it even now, but I don't trust it like at all. It gave me wrong answers like so many times.\\n\\nShristi 21:15\\nChatGPT or MyAI?\\n\\nP5 21:18\\nChat GPT\\n\\nShristi 21:21\\nOK! So did it  give you wrong answers for like academic stuff?\\n\\nP5 21:24\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi 21:25\\nYeah, totally makes sense when it like, confidently gives you the wrong answer. You don't even know about it. Yeah.\\n\\nP5 21:27\\nNowadays what I do is like a first Snapchat. I just talk to you about personal stuff like or something that's happening to me or something fun. But for academic stuff, I just use chat GPT in place of SnapChat, because I just think that makes more sense. I don't know why, but nowadays I'm like if I ask one question to the chat GPT I asked him the same question twice to make sure because I don't trust it at all. it made so many mistakes. So what I do is I ask the question and answers me and I and I said like Are you sure? And it's like it, it does it again and then it gets something. And then I and then again this really correct and then it gives me another answer. So I don't trust it.\\n\\nShristi 22:38\\nOK, so you just make sure by giving it like by making it a try for like multiple times so that you know you got the right answer. OK, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 22:43\\nYeah, sometimes even that is wrong.\\n\\nShristi 22:46\\nOK, so yeah, connecting to that in your experience, do you feel that there are some similarities between my AI and ChatGPT?\\n\\nP5 23:03\\nYeah, there are similarities. Like they both answer to you, if you have some questions you  just ask it to like both of like Snapchat, my AI and the chat GPT and it just answers you. I think that's the similar thing. Yeah, it's the same. Not not act exactly same, but it is similar.\\n\\nShristi 23:28\\nSo what do you think are the differences between my AI versus ChatGPT?\\n\\nP5 23:39\\nI think for ChatGPT is like more it's. I don't know. I think it's serious like because it doesn't have, you know, it's it's technically made for academic stuff. So I think that's more sophisticated. I don't know if that's the right word, but yeah. But, MyAI is so chill; we can use We can use emojis with it.  We can we can use anything. It's like more fun and personal, so if you ask me I when I have to talk about myself or like something I need or or something personal, I would choose MyAI. But if I have to learn about something or if I have to ask questions about academic stuff and educational stuff. I would rather use ChatGPT.\\n\\nShristi 24:37\\nUmm, so when you are talking with MyAI,  have you ever seen ads or sponsored content?\\n\\nP5 24:47\\nYeah. Once or twice, not not much, but I have seen him once or twice because when I ask when I ask about recommendations, sometimes what it does it like it sends uh, you know, first what? I don't know if it's it can be called add or not, but uh it sends me like four or five recommendations and for one of them it also sends like the whole poster thing.\\n\\nShristi 25:15\\nOhh OK, so it sounds you extra information?\\n\\nP5 25:17\\nNot extra information, but like, especially when uh asking over like restaurants or brands or something first, I don't know, like it it doesn't do it all the time, but sometimes what it does is it is it sends you know the like poster of the restaurant thing like with menus sometime menus and all and the prices and everything. It doesn't do it for every everything, but sometimes I don't know what happens. It just sends like randomly like random restaurant.\\n\\nShristi 26:00\\nUmm, OK, so when you are talking with it and you suddenly see a sponsored content or like an ad, so how does that usually make you feel?\\n\\nP5 26:01\\nI don't think it's like that bad because it's not like the YouTube ads or something. It just sends it and it forgets about it. So like the topic gets carried on, so I don't think it does much. Yeah, I don't think it even matters.\\n\\nShristi 26:25\\nI think we have talked about the trust thing related to ChatGPT already, but connecting it more to MyAI. How reliable do you find the responses by my AI?\\n\\nP5 26:48\\nI think it's quite like when I need personal like suggestions or I even talked to it when I'm kind of feeling low because it just like hikes me up suddenly and it gives so many positive affirmations. So I think it's quite reliable, especially for people who are feeling like low, who are kind of in the verse of, you know, going into depression or something. I think it and it answers you in such a way that it makes you feel validated and like it makes you feel like you are, you know, you're not wrong. I don't know it's reliable in that aspect, but for some aspect like for umm, if you ask certain like questions specific questions which has like specific answers to it, sometimes it does give you wrong answers.\\n\\nShristi 27:28\\nOK, so for example, if you're, I don't know, like looking for a place recommendations or maybe yeah, just the phone thing, right. It got it wrong. So for those kinds of tasks. So if for example you need to like find place of like plan a trip or buy something, do you trust MyAI`s  responses related to those tasks?\\n\\nP5 28:12\\nYeah, most of the time, I do trust it, but sometimes what I like to do is search it up and, like, ask to the MyAI and then go to the Google and search about it by myself. Like because some of them information might be wrong. Yeah, let's say 80%, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 28:30\\nSo so you just, OK, so you use the MyAI  responses as like the starting point and do your own research, yeah.\\n\\nP5 28:38\\nYeah, because I just, I I just don't think that I can go to a certain place that it recommended without looking for like anything else because that might be anything I might not like it or something. So I trusted but like not 100%.\\n\\nShristi 29:01\\nUmm, so building on the trust thing because I am so you might have shared something personal or or you might do it on a regular basis when you share a personal things with MyAI. So what are your concerns if there are any regarding the information that you are sharing is used by the company or  just Snapchat in general?\\n\\nP5 29:33\\nSo I'm type of person who's open to sharing everything? Like I don't mind if everybody knows what's going on in my life. I just feel like sometimes, even when I'm like, feeling very low or, you know, I just carry on with my life and I think sharing that thing with other people might make them inspired or something, you know, like, just make them feel like they're not alone in that. So I don't mind if my information is used by the company, but like I'm sometimes I'm also scared that the personal matters that I shared with Might be like publicized or something. I just sometimes it's just like random thoughts.\\n\\nShristi 30:25\\nUmm, so when you were just being the devil's advocate and just imagining the worst case possible.\\n\\nP5 30:27\\nYeah, I'm scared of that thing. But I still like I don't share like very, very, very important things with MyAI. But the things which are I think OK, even if it gets publicized or something, I just share those stuff.\\n\\nShristi 30:50\\nSo yeah, uh, those where the prospective questions that I had. Thank you so much for answering everything so much in detail. So before we leave, do you have anything to talk about in MyAI which you think we left in our conversation?\\n\\nP5 31:12\\nI don't know, but I think, yeah, I realized one thing that like when I when I asked about like recommendation for a filter it sends me like so bad filter like that was bad.\\n\\nShristi 31:22\\nOhh I do remember it. Ohh I thought I would ask you about it. So I think you told it like ohh I don't like this culture or something. And then it opt apologize.\\n\\nP5 31:37\\nYeah, like it was not bad. I liked the filter but I don't wanna use the dog filter all the time. I mean, I know about it. I just don't wanna use it. It's like childish or something. We just use it for fun. When when we would like small children, I just. I didn't like it.\\n\\nShristi 31:56\\nThat was liking the first filter that was super popular.\\n\\nP5 32:05\\nYeah. And when I said can you send me something else? I don't like it. It sent me another filter which is the same thing like the dog filter itself.\\n\\nShristi 32:11\\nOhh OK, so it was the same filter.\\n\\nP5 32:14\\nYeah, I felt like it was obsessed with dogs. I don't think, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 32:21\\nMakes sense. Yeah, I think that that could be like one of the experiences where you're like it's not, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 32:32\\nOK. So yeah, thank you so much for being a part of the interview.\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\ufeffTranscript P1_Interview\\nMarch 11, 2024, 7:05PM\\n\\nShristi  0:07\\nOk.\\nOK, so we have started the recording and transcription.\\nI just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions.\\nSo can you tell us a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP1  0:21\\nSure. Umm.\\nSo my name is [--].\\nI'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program.\\nThis is my second to last semester.\\nUmm before that I'm.\\nI'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years.\\nDecided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer.\\n\\nShristi   1:02\\nUmm, thank you.\\nSo which social media platforms are using currently?\\n\\nP1  1:10\\nUmm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok.\\n\\nShristi 1:22\\nAnd Tiktok.\\nOK umm so.\\nUmm.\\nSo when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you've been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so?\\n\\nP1  1:31\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi  1:38\\nDo you remember when you started using Snapchat?\\n\\nP1   1:41\\nYeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I first started using it.\\nAnd I was definitely a lot more active on it early on.\\nI'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much.\\nAnd my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories.\\n\\nShristi   2:15\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1  2:20\\nSo because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much.\\nAnd my friends aren't.\\nI don't go it on it too much anymore.\\nI literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing.\\n\\nShristi   2:36\\nUmm.\\nOK.\\nSo yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera?\\n\\nP1   2:51\\nYeah.\\nSo I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notifications from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories.\\n\\nShristi   3:16\\nOK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family?\\n\\nP1   3:23\\nI do.\\nIt's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while.\\n\\nShristi   3:30\\nYeah, and.\\n\\nP1   3:34\\nAnd like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot.\\nSo I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends.\\nLike if I think of them every once in a while.\\n\\nShristi   3:54\\nHmm.\\nOK, makes sense.\\nSo how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study?\\n\\nP1   4:03\\nUmm, I actually have not used it.\\nI..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my first thought was like I really had no interest in trying it.\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   4:20\\nYeah. OK.\\n\\nP1   4:21\\nIt just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it.\\nLike back when it was first released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out.\\n\\nShristi   4:53\\nYeah, yeah, of course.\\nOhm.\\nSo I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now.\\n\\nP1   5:06\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   5:06\\nUmm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI?\\nSo you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went.\\n\\nP1   5:23\\nSure.\\n\\nShristi   5:27\\nIf you remember it.\\n\\nP1   5:29\\nYeah.\\nSo did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?\\n\\nShristi   5:35\\nYeah, of course.\\n\\nP1   5:37\\nOK, sure.\\nSo the one I remember the most was my first time using it.\\nUmm.\\nAnd it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US.\\n\\nShristi   5:56\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:00\\nAnd so for that one.\\nI wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me.\\n\\nShristi   6:07\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:08\\nLike decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good.\\n\\nShristi   6:16\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   6:16\\nSo umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar.\\nSo like I think the first thing I said was like, hi, how are you?\\n\\nShristi   6:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:32\\nLike how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model.\\n\\nShristi   6:41\\nNo.\\n\\nP1   6:42\\nSo it was interesting that I like felt like doing that.\\nAnd then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.\\nAnd I've noticed that my like conversation.\\nNo, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back.\\n\\nWell, at first I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts.\\n\\nP1   8:15\\nUmm.\\nSo yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions.\\n\\nShristi   8:34\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   8:35\\nAnd it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the final recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night.\\nSo I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary.\\nI actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by.\\n\\nUmm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days.\\n\\nShristi   9:30\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   9:45\\nAnd I'm like, I don't know about that.\\n\\nShristi   9:48\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   9:48\\nAnd also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources.\\nUmm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in.\\n\\nShristi   10:46\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   10:46\\nAnd so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore.\\n\\nShristi   10:55\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   10:58\\nLike the same like trip when I actually was, but I like.\\n\\nShristi   10:59\\nUmm, you know?\\n\\nP1   11:02\\nI thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip.\\nUmm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was fine.\\n\\nShristi   11:14\\nOhh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else.\\n\\nP1   11:27\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   11:28\\nSo yeah, so much for sharing that.\\nSo I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?\\n\\nP1   11:37\\nMm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better.\\n\\nShristi   12:24\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   12:24\\nLike I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me?\\nAnd because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary.\\n\\nShristi   12:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   12:43\\nA recommendation was definitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker.\\n\\nShristi   13:01\\nUmm.\\nUmm, OK, thank you.\\nSo..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back?\\n\\nP1   13:34\\nUmm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation.\\nI like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time.\\n\\nShristi   13:55\\nHmm hmm.\\n\\nP1   14:06\\nUmm.\\nLike if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option.\\nUmm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should have like asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews.\\n\\nShristi   14:52\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   14:56\\nLike from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products.\\n\\nShristi   15:10\\nYep.\\n\\nP1   15:11\\nIt did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that.\\n\\nShristi   15:30\\nUmm. Given of course.\\nOK, makes sense.\\nSo moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot?\\n\\nP1   15:46\\nUmm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time.\\n\\nShristi   16:30\\nUmm OK.\\n\\nP1   16:33\\nSo pretty effortless.\\n\\nShristi   16:36\\nOK.\\nSo do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well?\\n\\nP1   16:47\\nUmm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.\\n\\nShristi   17:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   17:01\\nYou would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations.\\nLike if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed.\\nAnd if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human.\\n\\nShristi   17:42\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   17:44\\nSo yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it.\\n\\nShristi   17:52\\nOK, so did you encounter any specific obstacles when you were using the tool?\\n\\nP1   18:05\\nAnd so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones.\\n\\nShristi   18:29\\nHmm.\\nSo when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers?\\n\\nP1   18:43\\nUmm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh.\\n\\nShristi   18:49\\nOK.\\n\\nP1   18:52\\nOK.\\nCan you guys hear me alright?\\n\\nShristi   18:54\\nYeah, we do.\\n\\nP1   18:56\\nUh, yeah.\\nSo whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like.\\nCan you give me links with pictures?\\nSo I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing.\\nBut in other times.\\nI think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like specific models of backpacks within this brand and like specific colors.\\nIt then gave me specific models but not specific colors.\\n\\nShristi   20:00\\nUmm. OK. Makes sense.\\nSo when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the specific feature properly.\\n\\nP1   20:27\\nActually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it.\\n\\nShristi   20:50\\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.\\nSo I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it.\\n\\nP1   21:12\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   21:14\\nSo can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard?\\n\\nP1   21:18\\nYeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it.\\n\\nShristi   21:48\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   21:48\\nUh, or like banter with it?\\nAnd a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.\\nSo like. I don't remember. I..I remember one specifically, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out.\\n\\nShristi   22:32\\nOh really?\\n\\nP1   22:33\\nYeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm.\\n\\nShristi   22:43\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   22:46\\nUmm.\\nAnd yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it.\\nThat's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer.\\nLike I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers.\\n\\nShristi   23:07\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   23:11\\nLike I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing.\\n\\nShristi   23:21\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   23:23\\nSo yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people.\\n\\nShristi   23:28\\nOK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it?\\n\\nP1   23:43\\nUmm, I would say no.\\nBecause all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny.\\nBut it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing.\\n\\nShristi   24:10\\nMakes sense.\\nOhm so.\\nSo if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone?\\n\\nP1   24:26\\nUmm.\\nI'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh.\\nWhat am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it.\\n\\nShristi   25:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   25:36\\nSo like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever.\\n\\nShristi   25:36\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   25:41\\nAnything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all.\\n\\nShristi   25:45\\nYeah, makes sense.\\n\\nP1   25:49\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   25:50\\nSo have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI?\\n\\nP1   26:04\\nNo, I I don't think so.\\n\\nShristi   26:07\\nHmm, OK.\\nSo have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI?\\n\\nP1   26:21\\nI think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.\\n\\nShristi   26:27\\nUmm so so.\\n\\nP1   26:28\\nWhich is just, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   26:30\\nHmm.\\nSo, so so when so when you are using chat GPT.\\nSo do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines?\\n\\nP1   26:49\\nUmm.\\nI have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example.\\n\\nShristi   27:20\\nMm-hmm.\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   27:29\\nLike I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others.\\n\\nShristi   28:21\\nUmm.\\nUmm yeah, sure.\\nSo do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have?\\n\\nP1   28:40\\nI'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm.\\nI think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure.\\nUh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need.\\nAnd I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not specifically asking like the Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like.\\n\\nShristi   29:51\\nUmm.\\nOK. Makes sense.\\nUmm.\\nSo if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things?\\n\\nP1   30:08\\nUmm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this.\\n\\nShristi   30:22\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   30:31\\nLike Ohh knowing like machine somewhere.\\n\\nShristi   30:35\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   30:36\\nWhere it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different.\\n\\nShristi   31:06\\nYeah, I think that's that's fair.\\nSo when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads?\\n\\nP1   31:19\\nUmm.\\nOhh no, I don't think so.\\n\\nShristi   31:28\\nOhh OK really OK.\\n\\nP1   31:30\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   31:32\\nUmm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding back and giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least.\\n\\nP1   31:48\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   31:49\\nAnd you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat?\\n\\nP1   32:02\\nYeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin.\\n\\nShristi   32:10\\nOK.\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   32:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   32:11\\nSo maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed.\\n\\nP1   32:15\\nIt just knows, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   32:17\\nYeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then.\\nOK, so so when you receive any recommendations.\\nSo for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that?\\n\\nP1   32:42\\nUmm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way.\\n\\nShristi   33:06\\nOK, makes sense.\\n\\nP1   33:08\\nUh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.\\n\\nShristi   33:29\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   33:33\\nIt almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not.\\n\\nShristi   33:45\\nUmm.\\nUmm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you finish the conversation.\\n\\nP1   33:53\\nI think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that.\\n\\nShristi   34:11\\nHmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry.\\n\\nP1   34:42\\nUh, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   34:42\\nOhh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reflect back on that experience a little bit for us?\\n\\nP1   34:53\\nYeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to fly?\\n\\nShristi   35:15\\nThis is.\\n\\nP1   35:20\\nAnd I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke.\\n\\nShristi   35:27\\nUmm. Yeah.\\n\\nP1   35:32\\nAnd then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it.\\nLike this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes?\\nAnd then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it.\\n\\nShristi   36:11\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nYeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously.\\n\\nP1   36:22\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   36:24\\nYeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you filters.\\n\\nP1   36:34\\nOhh yeah.\\n\\nShristi   36:34\\nOhm, I'm so.\\nSo can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us?\\n\\nP1   36:42\\nYeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like.\\n\\nP1   36:56\\nAsk it to recommend a filter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and first of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway.\\n\\nShristi   37:00\\nUmm.\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   37:11\\nSo I don't know what that was about.\\n\\nShristi   37:15\\nOK.\\n\\nP1   37:16\\nBut yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a filter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat filter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the filter homepage.\\n\\nShristi   37:45\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   37:47\\nOf the camera like tab.\\n\\nShristi   37:49\\nThe where we where we take, where we take new snaps.\\n\\nP1   37:53\\nYeah.\\nLike when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the filters.\\n\\nShristi   38:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   38:00\\nIt was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that specific cat filter.\\n\\nShristi   38:04\\nThat OK. Umm, so.\\nSo when you were not able to reach the specific filter, how how did it make you feel at the time?\\n\\nP1   38:19\\nYou know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this filter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   38:45\\nYeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right.\\n\\nP1   38:49\\nYeah. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nShristi   38:51\\nOK. Yeah, makes sense.\\nOK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.\\nSo I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more specific I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP1   39:17\\nYeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual?\\n\\nShristi   39:24\\nYeah.\\nIn terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes?\\n\\nP1   39:45\\nYeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times.\\nSo maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to.\\n\\nShristi   40:11\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   40:31\\nBut I wouldn't take it at face value.\\n\\nShristi   40:38\\nYeah, right.\\n\\nP1   40:40\\nAnd like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other?\\n\\nShristi   41:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   41:01\\nUh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account?\\nDoes it know how expensive it is?\\n\\nShristi   41:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   41:11\\nDoes it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?\\n\\nShristi   41:15\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   41:16\\nIt's like for like minute details.\\nI I would do that research on my own.\\n\\nShristi   41:23\\nHmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with.\\n\\nP1   41:34\\nBasically, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   41:35\\nYeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those?\\n\\nP1   42:11\\nYeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself?\\n\\nShristi   42:37\\nI mean.\\n\\nP1   42:41\\nSo I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself.\\n\\nShristi   42:52\\nUmm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reflecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for?\\n\\nP1   43:16\\nUmm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively.\\nUm and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to figure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality or something to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future.\\n\\nShristi   44:02\\nOK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and.\\n\\nKadir   44:05\\nI have a quick question.\\nI have a quick question.\\n\\nP1   44:09\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   44:09\\nJust before finishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate.\\n\\nP1   44:24\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   44:27\\nI mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to figure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that?\\n\\nP1   44:54\\nYeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference.\\n\\nKadir   45:13\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   45:13\\nProbably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human.\\nAnd. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even.\\n\\nKadir   45:29\\nHmm.\\n\\nP1   45:32\\nUmm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the Snapchat AI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT.\\n\\nKadir   46:06\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   46:12\\nNo. Yeah.\\n\\nKadir   46:14\\nHmm.\\nHmm, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   46:17\\nMe, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for specifically for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for?\\n\\nP1   46:37\\nUmm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned?\\n\\nShristi   47:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:01\\nI'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games.\\nLike maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it.\\n\\nShristi   47:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:11\\nUmm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games.\\nRight. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or.\\n\\nShristi   47:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:30\\nIf it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.\\n\\nShristi   47:49\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:59\\nSo somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case.\\n\\nKadir   48:07\\nUmm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here.\\n\\nShristi   48:14\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   48:17\\nThat's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that?\\n\\nP1   48:47\\nUh, could you say that again? So like uh?\\n\\nKadir   48:51\\nSure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings.\\n\\nP1   49:09\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir   49:26\\nAs far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong.\\n\\nP1   49:27\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir   49:29\\nAnd how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI?\\n\\nP1   49:49\\nYeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine.\\n\\nKadir   50:07\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   50:08\\nThat's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations.\\n\\nKadir   50:13\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:15\\nAnd I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more.\\n\\nKadir   50:29\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:40\\nOr, uh, like like human?\\nLike so.\\n\\nKadir   50:46\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:46\\nLike if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know.\\nLike why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers.\\n\\nKadir   50:54\\nUmm. Yeah. Thanks very much.\\n\\nP1   51:07\\nYeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted.\\n\\nKadir   51:13\\nOhh wait, you're you're muted.\\n\\nShristi   51:16\\nI do it all the time.\\nI'm sorry.\\n\\nP1   51:18\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   51:19\\nSo yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention?\\n\\nP1   51:30\\nNo, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun.\\nThanks for inviting me to participate.\\n\\nShristi   51:36\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nKadir   51:37\\nDefinitely.\\n\\nShristi   51:37\\nYeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\\n\", \"\\ufeffTranscript P4_Interview\\nMarch 25, 2024\\n\\nShristi 0:06\\nOK, it's the recording has started.\\nSo I'll just first start with a few warm-up questions.\\nLet's just get comfortable around each other.\\nSo for that, can you tell me a little bit about yourself first?\\n\\n\\nP4 0:22\\nYeah! My name is Jacob. I'm a sophomore at Iowa State. I'm studying math education.\\nI like music. I'm in the marching band here, and I like to play basketball for fun.\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:35\\nOhh it's great. Thank you so much.\\nSo Jacob, what social media platforms do you use?\\n\\n\\nP4 0:47\\nI would say pretty regularly I use Snapchat and Instagram and then on occasion I use TikTok.\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:54\\nOK. Do you remember when you started using Snapchat?\\n\\n\\nP4 1:02\\nProbably sometime in middle school, so that would probably be about six or seven years ago.\\n\\n\\nShristi 1:09\\nOK, so since you are even a frequent user right now, so can you tell me what do you do most on Snapchat?\\n\\nP4 1:17\\nI send pictures to friends or like it's pretty easy to message a friend and I I do really like the feature of making group chats on Snapchat and that's pretty convenient for like a group project and stuff like that.\\n\\n\\nShristi 1:29\\nOK, so do you also collaborate with your, I don`t know, colleagues like friends from task to do projects as well?\\n\\nP4 1:38\\nYes.\\n\\nShristi 1:40\\nOK. I had never heard of that before. Just making sure I got it right. So have you ever used the Snapchat   MyAI feature before taking part in this study?\\n\\nP4 1:57\\nYes, I have. It was mainly just the kind of like test to see what it could do, like I didn't do like anything like as intricate as the study required, But I have like messed with it a little bit before.\\n\\n\\nShristi 2:07\\nUmm, OK. So do you remember when you first played with it or tried it using it?\\n\\nP4 2:14\\nYeah, I kind of did similar stuff like like I would do to ChatGPT which is like I was seeing how you could like test it with prompts like for example one time I asked a question and I said like only responding emojis is to see how he would try to do that. It's like just stuff like play with it. Nothing like super in depth.\\n\\nShristi 2:34\\nSo moving on, so can you tell me or show me an example of how you used Snapchat MyAI? you can talk about something that you did as a part of this study or something outside of it.\\n\\n\\nP4 2:50\\nSomething I did for this study was to get travel recommendations for like a three-day trip and I like one of the things I could do to, like, narrow down the prompt. Once I initially asked was like give my location and like give a pricing. If I thought like a hotel was too expensive, I kind of asked like are there any cheaper options and it referred me to the cheaper options. And what I liked about it was it showed you like like a, you know, like the like, the global Snapchat stories people can upload it and showed you that of that hotel. So you could see like actually what the inside of the hotel looked like and what was going on at the time.\\n\\n\\nShristi 3:20\\nUh-huh. So you could see what other people snapped about the place?\\n\\n\\nP4 3:32\\nYes, like if it gave you location, there was like a little circle, you could click on.I think it took a screenshot of it and sent it and it would open like the like the public stories people would post. So you could see like them like showing Snapchat stories like at that hotel or in the area. So if there's like a festival or event going on, you could like see what's actually happening.\\n\\nShristi 3:53\\nOh, that's cool. I didn't know about that, actually. That's great.\\n\\nShristi 3:56\\nSo the travel recommendation thing that you did, would it be similar to things that you would generally do on MyAI?\\n\\nP4 4:12\\nOhh like are you saying? Like what? I actually like to use it for travel travel recommendations like in my own time.\\n\\nShristi 4:17\\nSo is it do you think that certain example depicts what you usually do on MyAI?\\n\\nP4 4:26\\nI would say prior to the study, no, just because I didn't really know how useful it would be, but like looking back now, I would like going on in the future. But I would say previously I would not have thought about doing that.\\n\\n\\nShristi 4:35\\nOK, so based on any interaction that you did as a part of the study or maybe something outside of it, have you ever found MyAI to be useful?\\n\\nP4 4:51\\nPrior to the study, I would say no, I didn't use it in depth like say just  Googling something or ChatGPT, so I didn't really know the capabilities before the study.\\n\\nShristi 5:05\\nMakes sense! So after the study, do you think there might be use cases for you for MyAI in the coming future?\\n\\n\\nP4 5:15\\nYeah, like I really did like the convenience of it. And I do like cooking and I think I mentioned that it would be pretty easy to ask like, how do I substitute this for recipe or like pretty easy to live ask it a specific question without having to Google and filter through results.\\n\\nShristi 5:33\\nCan you share an experience where you felt MyAI meet your expectations?\\n\\nP4 5:52\\nI would say just like with the trivia game, it did. It was pretty straightforward. It was just like I asked it to, like, give me a I think it was Star Wars trivia and it like gave an answer or get, gave a question with four different answers in multiple choice. It was pretty straightforward.\\n\\nShristi 6:08\\nSo when you say straightforward, what do you like about the interaction that happened during the game?\\n\\n\\nP4 6:20\\nUmm, when you gave an answer, if it was wrong, it would like explain why it gave context instead of like just like instantly giving you like what was right what was wrong. I liked how it kind of explained, and at once there was one point that was kind of confusing, and I asked it to explain, and it did explain like quite a bit more than just like otherwise I'd have to like Google it and like figure it on my own. But I did like how it it explained it pretty well.\\n\\n\\nShristi 6:45\\nCan you share an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations?\\n\\nP4 6:56\\nI would say umm. I asked it for like the three-day trip that was a prompt. I asked it for travel directions and like I I gave where I was like I said, Ames, IA and it couldn't give like directions. it said it for some reason it didn't have my location, which I was kind of confused because I thought like, you know, Snapchat gonna has your location. So you would have to use an external app and like it recommended apps to use, but it couldn't itself give you directions.\\n\\n\\nShristi 7:29\\nYeah, I saw that interaction in one of your screen captures. So when you said you thought Snapchat usually has your location, so because there is a setting where you can turn it on or off. So for yours, have you turned on the location setting for Snapchat?\\n\\nP4 7:49\\nYes, because like that I know. Like there's like that Snapmap feature in mine is on.\\n\\nShristi  7:54\\nOK. Thank you for clearing that up. So when you were using MyAI for the four days during the study, or even beyond that in general, how much effort do you think was required to use MyAI?\\n\\nP4 8:13\\nUh, not much. Because like most of the stuff was like pretty general, I think sometimes you kind of had to narrow it down to like if you wanted like a more specific response. But that's like really on you if you want, like like a specific category like like I was saying with like a hotel, like a cheaper hotel. You kinda have to specify that, but I would say overall you don't have to like put that much effort into it.\\n\\n\\nShristi 8:34\\nSo when you say it was not much effort, why do you think it was not a lot of effort, even if you had to narrow down what you were asking a lot of times or maybe switch up what questions you were asking, why do you think it was not a lot of effort?\\n\\n\\nP4 8:55\\nBecause like where it differs versus like Google is like holds on like what you were just talking about. And I think like the context of what you're previous prompt was, it holds that over. So I don't have to like restate something. Like it'll kind of like think like of like about base and what you already said like how to narrow down more. So I think with the how I use this context as why it's easier than like a Googling something.\\n\\n\\nShristi 9:20\\nYeah, that that makes it helpful for me to understand. So do you think that anybody you needed any special skills for using MyAI well?\\n\\n\\nP4 9:37\\nThere might be some skill into like getting a very specific prompt, but overall is pretty intuitive and like I think you could even like ask it for help on how to use it effectively and probably answer that well, but overall I did not. I'm not super like tech knowledgeable and I didn't have any difficulty with it.\\n\\nShristi 9:56\\nSo when you are using MyAI, did you face any obstacles that you encountered?\\n\\n\\nP4 10:13\\nIt's not a big obstacle, but there is the whole location thing and it couldn't give me directions. And I think one time during the trivia game, it did actually like mess up which answer was correct? But that was it. And I wanna say, those weren't really obstacles because like it didn't really like ruin the experience at all. So overall, I wouldn't say there weren't really, really many obstacles at all.\\n\\n\\nShristi 10:36\\nUmm, so when you found that MyAI got confused with the trivia question, do you remember how you attempted to resolve the problem?\\n\\n\\nP4 11:02\\nYeah, I believe I responded and said I was pretty sure it should be like this other answer, and then like, I think my response with ohh like yeah like upon like looking into it more like yeah that's correct. Like I apologize for my mistake and it kind of like corrected itself.\\n\\nShristi 11:17\\nSo I do remember there was that this interaction was quite interesting for me when when you remember when I think it was the third day activity where you had to like stand stickers and pictures and you had sent the dragon one and and you kept telling the AI this is this character from Mario. Don't you, like, recognize this?\\n\\n\\nP4 11:38\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 11:39\\nAnd then you send a picture like the sticker again and it it does not recognize at all.\\n\\nP4 11:44\\nYes, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 11:46\\nDid you feel any, you know, discomfort or problem when the interactions were going in that direction at the time?\\n\\nP4 11:56\\nOK, I'm glad you got that. You brought that up because I totally forgot about that. But yeah, like I was impressed with how like it recognizes like a photo very well. Like if you send like a selfie like it'll be like, oh, like I see it's night or like it can tell, like, very well, it's going on in the background. But the stickers, like it was just a picture. Yeah, Bowser from Mario and like at first, it didn't recognize it. And I said Ohh, it's Bowser and it's like, uh, like, yeah, I know what that is. And like like you were saying, I kept resending it just like did not recognize that no matter how many times I sent it. So I don't know. I wouldn't say it was discomfort, but I just kind of like I was surprised that it's able to pick up like a photo background so well, but it can't pick up the sticker very well at all.\\n\\n\\nShristi 12:33\\nYeah, I think maybe because it's asserting character. Maybe. Yeah, that's something interesting to look into, for sure. So when you were using MyAI, did you feel like you had access to necessary resources or support to use MyAI properly?\\n\\n\\nP4 12:57\\nYeah, I think so. I think it's pretty like, well contained. We're like it can answer your own questions very well. I did like how like on certain prompts it would give you like good follow-up questions. You could just click on and it would ask it for you and answer right away and like on the occasional time like with the directions it would refer you to like a better application that you could use. So I would say overall it's pretty useful and like even if it doesn't have like the right resource, it can like refer you pretty well.\\n\\nShristi 13:19\\nOK, so when so I think for the study we did tell you about it and we asked you to use it, but apart from us, have you have you heard somebody else talk about MyAI, it could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet?\\n\\n\\nP4 13:51\\nJust when you was very new, like when it was first coming out, people were talking about it and like using an A lot and like seeing what they could do with it. But that's really the only time I've heard of like people I know using it.\\n\\nShristi 14:04\\nSo had there been anybody who encouraged you to, you know, like use the tool?\\nIt might be someone who said something to you personally, or maybe you saw people talking about it on the Internet, telling people who use MyAI.\\n\\nP4 14:25\\nI hadn't heard my friends like about this, but I I think I saw somewhere online that like after like the photo feature was like kind of unable to was cool like to see like how it responded like certain pictures like I saw that and I was interested so like I would send it like random pictures of like maybe like a forest near me in different stuff like I would see what it would say to that and it's pretty interesting to see how like how well it was at like describing the photo you would send.\\n\\n\\nShristi 14:51\\nSo when you first tried MyAI, when it first came out, did you try it? You know, because I think Snapchat sent push notifications and like a message to everybody about, hey, this is a new feature we have. So did you try it because of that? Or maybe because you saw other people doing it.\\n\\n\\nP4 15:15\\nI never remember getting a push notification, but I do remember like other people using it to like that made me wanna try it out. So I'd say, yeah, from other people.\\n\\n\\nShristi 15:24\\nSo after using it, you know for a few days based on what you've interacted with, would you recommend other people to try using MyAI?\\n\\n\\nP4 15:41\\nYeah, I think I would. I think this study definitely made me realize, like how actually like, useful and versatile it can be. And I think for like like the different prompts you gave or are good examples. And like, it's funny, like even like the other day, I kind of asked, like, where's like a good restaurant to eat like, that was independent from the study and actually give me a a good, a good response and actually went to that restaurant. I recommend. It was really good.\\n\\n\\nShristi 16:04\\nSo in addition to looking for restaurants, have you, you know, found yourself using MyAI apart from our study?\\n\\nP4 16:17\\nUh, not yet, but I'm sure in the future I will.\\n\\nShristi 16:20\\nOK so after using MyAI, have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\\n\\n\\nP4 16:33\\nI'm not sure 'cause I like I said it hasn't been that long since the study. So I would say like, not too. I haven't noticed a big difference, I would say.\\n\\nShristi 16:44\\nOK, makes sense. So do you think you have used in the past or are currently using something that is similar to MyAI?\\n\\n\\nP4 16:58\\nYes, I have used ChatGPT before.\\n\\nShristi 17:01\\nOK, so when you are using a chat GPT versus when you are using MyAI, do you feel there are any similarities between the two tools?\\n\\nP4 17:16\\nI think definitely like in responses. I do notice like the structure of responses are pretty similar and you can kind of like tell ohh this is likely AI generated and like I think like you know it's very similar to like how you like input a prompt in that response. So I'd say they're pretty similar in that aspect.\\n\\n\\nShristi 17:36\\nAnd going further from the similarity is, do you recognize any story differences between the two applications?\\n\\n\\nP4 17:49\\nI think definitely like the Snapchat one was distinct in like the Snapmap feature. And like how it how it utilizes like Snapchat's own features. Or you can like send in a photo and stuff like that whereas it's like ChatGPT is pretty separate and it's like just like the text aspect of it. So let's say that's a big difference.\\n\\n\\nShristi 18:09\\nWhile you were interacting with MyAI, did you see any ads or sponsored content?\\n\\nP4 18:22\\nYes, I did. It was strange because the first day I did not, but then the second day was like. It seemed like every prompt had one. It's just like, you know, like link you to Amazon and sometimes it was useful because, like, I think I like, like asked it about. I don't remember what the the prompt was like. Oh, like, where can I buy this near me? And it links me to an Amazon. And that was kind of useful, but otherwise it just seemed like every prompt had an ad that it didn't need.\\n\\nShristi 18:48\\nSo the sponsored ads that you were getting were not relevant to what you were asking at all?\\n\\nP4 19:01\\nI don't remember because like at a point I just kind of like ignored them because I just scrolled past. But like I remember thinking like, ohh, why is this? Why is there an ad for this like I was just asking a simple question, so I think there were times.\\n\\n\\nShristi 19:14\\nSo umm, so you know when you saw so many ads popping up, how did it make you feel at the time?\\n\\nP4 19:28\\nWhy I think at first I was surprised because I never knew that they had like sponsored ads in there. And then when it started, like becoming when it started to get to the point where, like every response and it was just, it just seemed like that one day it happened. I was like kind of frustrated, like, I'm like, why is there? Why is there an ad on every response here?\\n\\nShristi 19:47\\nSo during the interaction that we saw, we did find a few examples where you thought that the the response that you got were not accurate from MyAI. So having that pretext, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP4 20:15\\nI would say like Gene, generally like AI's or my eyes, like pretty good for like general stuff. I don't know if I would use it for something like statistics or like like more more recent information like I'd rather like Google that. But if it's like if it's like a like, it gave me a recipe for something like, I would trust that cause. It's just like a it's a recipe like I wouldn't ask anything like controversial, but if it's like a known thing that we've known for a long time, I would trust it there.\\n\\nShristi 20:43\\nSo when you say you would trust MyAI for non serious/personal stuff, So what kind of use cases do you think MyAI would help you in your daily life?\\n\\nP4 21:02\\nLike maybe stores near me. Like what those stores sell? Restaurants near me that are good, certain recipes that like stuff with food I think it would be good like earlier I was time of like if you maybe like if you're making a recipe and like you might not have a certain ingredient, I think MyAI  would be good to say ohh like what's a good substitute for this or like ohh I messed up this part of my recipe. Like how can I fix my cooking from here because that's like a more specific thing that like maybe Googling can't help with.\\n\\nShristi 21:33\\nDo you also feel comfortable using MyAI for something that's relevant to your academic tasks? Maybe learning something new or or even using it for something relevant in your assignments or maybe classes? Do you feel comfortable doing that?\\n\\nP4 21:53\\nI don't think it would be just cause like I don't know. I'd rather like either ask a professor or like, you know, find a different like more reliable source. I'm not sure because I don't know I wouldn't wanna like put that as like a source or, you know, I'd rather like do it independently, I feel like.\\n\\nShristi 22:10\\nSo when you were interacting it with stickers and pictures and even with your prompts, you might have shared something personal while interactive with MyAI. So what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by the company?\\n\\n\\nP4 22:35\\nI would say I'm actually like not super concerned because like I've never sent something over Snapchat that like I've been worried about getting out because I know like there's like a whole thing with like digital footprint. Like I I don't know like how they like translate the photo or like what they do with it, but like I just like make sure that I'm safe with it.\\nSo like if if what I put in is safe then like I know I'm not worried about it getting out.\\n\\nShristi 23:01\\nI think when we talked, I think we did not really talk much about the shopping task that we had, so do you remember how that shopping task went? If you remember, can you kind of walk us through what you did with it?\\n\\nP4 23:23\\nYeah, I think I just kind of like a niche like asked the broad question like hey, like what kind of stores are nearby me and like it told me at Walmart and Target and some other stories. And then from there I narrowed it down and said ohh like what does target sell? Like what does Walmart sell? Like can I buy this certain product at this store? Just like I started with like a broad term and then narrow it down, I would say the only issue with that was this was kind of like an off-side thing, but there's like a convenience store at Iowa State. And I asked it about that when they get it kind of got confused with like, a farmer's market at some point. But that was that was the only thing.\\n\\n\\nShristi 23:57\\nI do remember seeing that screenshot I think is that this little convenience store that's inside the. So is it the convenience store that's inside one of the apartments in in?\\n\\nP4 24:21\\nNo, I know you're talking about, but Union Drive Community Center.\\n\\nShristi 24:27\\nSo yeah, when you were talking with it about the convenience store, I think I think it give you like several recommendations of things you can find. I think by that time you realize that it was not talking about the convenience store and something else. And then you said, hey, it's not. I'm talking about this. So what products do you think can be found here? And I think the response MyAI gave was like pretty generic of what things you could find in any convenience store. It was like, hey, yeah, you can find sodas and snacks and stuff like that. So in in that interaction, how did you feel about the usefulness of the information in terms of the specific question that you had asked?\\n\\nP4 25:23\\nI would say I kind of realized that it wasn't super usefull for something that's specific like this certain small store. It's like not a good option for and I felt like I'd rather Google it or ask around at that point, whereas like something more broad like a big place like Walmart that you have like a lot of that's a good thing to ask MyAI for, but like a smaller store that might only have like one or a couple locations might not be as a that's good to ask about using MyAI.\\n\\nShristi 25:54\\nSo building a little bit upon the similarities and differences we talked about with ChatGPT, I think you've noticed that the way you talk with MyAI is a little bit different from what you would talk or or you know, like converse or communicate with ChatGPT. Because of the nature of what MyAI is represented as, does your interaction differ from what you would do with ChatGPT? Is there something different? How you pose the questions.\\n\\n\\nP4 26:38\\nI would think first I'll just like I would never like I was saying like use MyAI for academics. Since like I'm a MATH major, I might use ChatGPT if I'm confused on a concept I might use ChatGPT, like explain a some kind of concept to me in like a certain way that that way I could understand it better, whereas MyAI might be better for like we're saying like the cooking or travel recommendations. But I would like a prompt I would trust like ChadGPT more with like academic stuff, but I wouldn't rely on it fully of course.\\n\\n\\nShristi 27:15\\nSumming up, so summing up the entire interview. You've already talked about things that MyAI is good for, and I think you've already touched into it. But what cases do you think MyAI is not useful for at all?\\n\\n\\nP4 27:43\\nKind of like when I said it earlier, like anything super recent, anything that like people have a different opinion on like, controversial. I wanna use it for anything that's like like a statistic or fact. Or like ohh like can you like get a quote from this book for me? I'd rather like do that myself or like something academic. I don't think I would use MyAI for any of those things.\\n\\nShristi 28:06\\nSo yeah, that's all the questions that we had. Thank you so much for answering it. Yeah, we did it pretty fast. I was not expecting to be done with this early, but yeah, we had a good conversation. So before we end the recording, is there something that you would like to mention that we did not get around talking about?\\n\\nP4 28:30\\nUh, I guess it was interesting to see, like, I didn't realize, like the capability of MyAI before the study. So it kind of opened me up to like actually seeing like how you can utilize MyAI versus just kind of like messing around with it like I've realized it's actually pretty useful and have some good features.\\n\\n\\nKadir 28:56\\nUmm, so Jacob, I have a quick follow-up with one of your answers. You were saying that you would probably be feeling more reliable or you would think MyAI is not as reliable as ChatGPT for maybe serious tasks. I understand probably you are thinking about the responses you're getting from both systems and then maybe you are evaluating that reliability based on the responses. But other than the response quality, is there any other reasons why you think MyAI might seem less reliable than ChatGPT?\\n\\n\\nP4 29:46 \\nI don't even you know that's an interesting point. I can't really give any specifics on that because I've actually, I've never really tested it and like putting like a like a prompt like explain this concept to me before like that might be something to play around with because I wondered like I might just be thinking that cause like you know, I don't think of like Snapchat like the most professional thing. So it could just be like that kind of like setting like ohh, it's like snapchatting a like a friend, quote unquote when you're talking MyAI versus ChatGPR is more separated from that. So it could just be that. I think I might have to look into that more, but I wouldn't say that there's nothing really specific for my reasoning to be honest.\\n\\nKadir 30:26\\nOK. Thanks very much.\\n\\n\"]\n",

      "[\"Transcript P2_Interview\\nMarch  18, 2024, 12:10AM\\n\\n\\nShristi started transcription\\n\\nKadir   0:15\\nOK, perfect. So.\\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself, if possible?\\n\\nP2   0:25\\nLittle about myself?\\nKadir   0:27\\nYes, yes.\\n\\nP2   0:27\\nOK, so I'm a graduate student here, here at the [a US university], and now graduating this year.\\nSo I'm doing my civil engineering masters in civil engineering with an emphasis on Geotechnical engineering. I think I have been using Snapchat for the past three years. If you want to know.\\n\\nKadir   0:50\\nWow. Past three years, it's been quite a few kind of like experience probably it seems alright So then could you also tell me what social media platforms do you use other than, let's say, in this case, Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   1:10\\nUh, so Instagram. Facebook, mostly on Instagram and mostly Instagram. Other than that, Facebook, sometimes with Twitter, and that's all. If LinkedIn counts as social media, I did that while I was searching for jobs, but not anymore.\\n\\nKadir   1:28\\nSo we get an Instagram. Facebook OK. Yeah, that's that's fair. So. When when did you start using Snapchat? Uh.\\n\\nP2   1:46\\nSo yeah, it was like back and forth when I when I was back in [a South Asian Country]. So I usually use for like one month and then the not use that for like one year and then again come back.\\nBut after I came to US like it's been like 2 years, most probably. So I've been like continuously using it for the past two years.I would say.\\n\\nKadir   2:05\\nNo. OK. So just. Is there any umm what makes a continuous use in the US for Snapchat?\\nIs there any kind of like reason for?\\n\\nP2   2:18\\nAnd now, and there's not, not not this kind of disparity while competing with [a South Asian Country] and US, but just that when I am in the US, I could like connect with my friends, move through Snapchat with home in [a South Asian Country] So back back when I was in [a South Asian Country], I didn't didn't need to do that because I was actually there. So that makes it easy to like…\\n\\nKadir   2:36\\nOK, OK. Yeah.\\n\\nP2   2:37\\n..know what they're doing like in their daily life. And like you know about their situations, where it's pretty fun.\\n\\nKadir   2:43\\nYeah, I got it. That makes sense. That makes sense. I relate to that for sure.\\n\\nP2   2:49\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   2:50\\nWhat do you do most on on the on the Snapchat then could you tell us a little bit?\\n\\nP2   2:56\\nYeah. So. So I'm like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you're doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it's like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it's kind of like to. So what you're doing on a bit daily basis, so it's kind of fun.\\n\\nKadir   3:28\\nOK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well.\\n\\nP2   3:32\\nYeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   3:45\\nOK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   4:02\\nUh, so when it was first released, I don't know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don't know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was first released, but to be honest, after that I haven't really used this before this program or before your project.\\n\\nKadir   4:10\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:22\\nSo yeah, I don't have very much experience than you guys as well, so.\\n\\nKadir   4:22\\nUmm.\\nYeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was.\\n\\nP2   4:32\\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here.\\n\\nKadir   4:35\\nYeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it?\\n\\nP2   4:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat field whenever you Instagram.\\n\\nKadir   4:44\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:45\\nSo it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven't really used it.\\n\\nKadir   4:53\\nOK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature.\\n\\nP2   5:07\\nYeah. Yeah, I did.\\n\\nKadir   5:08\\nUh, yeah.\\n\\nP2   5:08\\nI did.\\n\\nKadir   5:09\\nSo then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn't related to the study.\\n\\nP2   5:21\\nYeah. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you first was. What was the first task? If you can remind me.\\n\\nKadir   5:34\\nI think we asked you to have a travel recommendation.\\n\\nP2   5:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn't think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days.\\nI have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the first answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary.\\n\\nKadir   5:58\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   6:03\\nIt give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing.\\nSo I..I was kind of like I didn't check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing.\\n\\nKadir   6:20\\nOhh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details.\\n\\nP2   6:27\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   6:27\\nOK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that first task?\\n\\nP2   6:40\\nNo, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So first of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   6:59\\nOK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences.\\n\\nP2   7:16\\nMy prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the “guess the country's flag” game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that's all I have.\\n\\nKadir   7:34\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   7:36\\nIt's like kind of. It's not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it's it's kind of cool.\\n\\nKadir   7:47\\nYeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don't know, like kill time at the time and then.\\n\\nP2   7:53\\nYou're saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it.\\n\\nKadir   8:08\\nMm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience?\\n\\nP2   8:31\\nOK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I'm working on my thesis or something like that. So it's really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that's why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I've used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two.\\n\\nKadir   9:01\\nHmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations?\\n\\nP2   9:17\\nWith my expectations, OK, so.\\n\\nKadir   9:20\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   9:24\\nUmm. Let's see. I'm gonna. I'm going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker.\\n\\nKadir   9:37\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   9:39\\nIt didn't perform that well on this one. So I think the first the first tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me first suggestion on soccer cleats but didn't like it, didn't like provide like such great information on that.\\nAnd also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn't recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period.\\nIt's going like provide much information about there.\\nSo I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one.\\n\\nKadir   10:41\\nThe first one.\\n\\nP2   10:42\\nYeah. The first one was the. Yeah, it was the best one.\\n\\nKadir   10:46\\nThe the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it.\\n\\nP2   10:52\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.\\n\\nKadir   10:54\\nYeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember.\\n\\nP2   11:03\\nI..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nKadir   11:10\\nRocky mountains.\\n\\nP2   11:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:14\\nSo do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean?\\n\\nP2   11:20\\nThat's where I would go. Yeah, absolutely.\\nI gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life.\\n\\nKadir   11:23\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   11:29\\nSo and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that’s a place where I would definitely go in the future, so.\\n\\nKadir   11:36\\nMaybe that's why you it could be aligning. OK, OK.\\n\\nP2   11:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:40\\nI totally understand. Yeah. So then also, yeah. Can you share an experience where it didn't meet your expectations? And then yeah, that would be nice.\\n\\nP2   11:50\\nNo. OK, OK. So let me go over the task with the shopping list, right? The..where you wanted to do like buy something.\\n\\nKadir   11:59\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   12:05\\nI really needed a new..\\n\\nKadir   12:06\\nYou wanted to buy, right?\\n\\nP2   12:08\\nYeah, I I needed a new soccer cleats right now, so I just try to like incorporate that in the task as well. So I asked him to like, suggest me some soccer cleats based on my position of play like soccer field. So I play midfielders generally, so I wanted something light and something that lasted me long because last soccer cleat that I bought was like only for three or four months.\\nIt suggested me like 2..2 of the like most famous soccer cleats, which were like all over the Internet as so. Yeah. And I asked like, it is a well out of my budget. So can you like say say something in between like 150 to $200.00 but it still gave me the same same two models that it showed me like previously and after that what I did was I asked for like the pictures.\\nLike the pictures, if if you provide like pictures from the Internet but no it it couldn't provide that\\nSo I think that was the worst experience with me. So it's sort of like a prompt insert a picture of [inaudible] within like big brackets. You can see in the screenshots so it was kind of like not that good.\\n\\nKadir   13:14\\nYeah. What was lacking in in that?\\n\\nP2   13:17\\nYeah. So I I I asked the picture of like 2 soccer cleats that it was trying to show me earlier and it couldn't like provide me the picture and also the it couldn't like uh what do you say..suggest the price..uh..the cleats within my budget so. It it only knew about like 2 soccer cleats and it kind of like repeatedly went on and went on about the same thing again and again even if you asked like different questions.\\n\\nKadir   13:46\\nUmm, so it was not.. OK. Yeah, I I I got it. Definitely. So, uh, how much effort was required to use MyAI chatbot in your experiences so far?\\n\\nP2   14:05\\nI guess it depends on like what kind of question you’re asking. So again, so the first task that I did was like pretty smooth and I got what was required within like 3 or 4 questions or prompts.\\nBut for the..as I have said like..\\n\\nKadir   14:17\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   14:21\\nThe soccer cleats one.. the shopping list and also the describe the picture or something like that. So it took like will more than like ten tries to get even get like close to it. So it was like stuck on one thing and it's going to go like up from that. So even if I ask a lot of questions, so yeah, I think it depends on my experience. It depends on what you're actually trying to ask out of the MyAI feature.\\n\\nKadir   14:46\\nOK. So then as far as I understand, do you mean, I mean it depends on the topic. It depends on.\\n\\nP2   14:53\\nYeah, yeah. It depends on the topic and how well known the topic is. I most probably because National parks are like more searched than football cleats..I guess..all over the Internet and yeah, I did ask it about like this dish from [a South Asian Country] during my photo.. Task with the photo uploading a picture and then asking about the picture.\\n\\nSo it couldn't recognize that, and even if I like told it that it was like a dish from [a South Asian Country]. So it could not provide much information about that as well. So I think it depends on how what would people like asking the in the Internet more. So if you like talk about a least talked topic with the MyAI think it just like other time to like actually go into the topic you like you'll be stuck somewhere around like in the first two or three replies and then if you like try to get more out of it..it will take some time on those kind of topics.\\n\\nKadir   15:28\\nOK. Umm. I I get it. Yeah. When it start then it's it's not maybe forwarding with the conversation, unfortunately.\\n\\nP2   16:01\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:02\\nOK. So, uh, uh, do you think any skills are needed? Uh, any any skills are needed to use MyAI chatbot well or effectively let's say.\\n\\nP2   16:19\\nI think even like no basic English writing and reading then it would be enough. You doing anything so that you just need to know about the Snapchat interface interface and just the basic English that you do writing, typing, reading. So I think that that that's enough.So I don't think that's like too much.\\n\\nKadir   16:37\\nUmm, so basically kind of English proficiency and then kind of writing, typing and you said writing typing.\\n\\nP2   16:43\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:45\\nI mean, do you think? By writing, is there any? Specific skills for.\\n\\nP2   16:55\\nAnd not have I just writing because like the way the AI AI reacts to your message like it largely or it mostly depends on your prompt right.\\nIf you like, try to get trying to get some information out of the MyAI but you are not like expressing yourself well in the prompt. So then it will like take wrong turn on like it will not understand what you'd like to say. So if you have like good understanding of English writing and reading and then a good understanding of Snapchat because you have to first of all go to MyAI to like type type it out. So if you have a good knowledge of that interface, then I think anyone can do this.\\n\\nKadir   17:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   17:32\\nAnyone, anyone can utilize this yeah.\\n\\nKadir   17:33\\nOK. OK. So just here I have one more follow up. So then do you think in terms of writing or typing? Different writing and prompting would would would differ. Do you think I mean how is your experience with that?\\n\\nP2   17:59\\nI think so. Yeah, I think like the way you write or like the way you present a prompt to an to MyAI. So it will definitely like the answer would be definitely different, so I don't know how to fix it, but yeah, if you like, try a write a prompt in it like a detailed manner.\\n\\nKadir   18:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   18:15\\nSo you should like express all the things that you need to get out of my head. Sometimes it might work, but sometimes it can't, like necessarily pushes all the information. I think like that.\\nSo that's why I always like start with the small short short, short prompt and then try to go into deep into the conversation after it kind of like replies in a good way or replies in a good direction.\\n\\nKadir   18:32\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   18:37\\nSo if yeah.\\n\\nKadir   18:39\\nOK.\\nUmm.\\nAnd in your experiences during the diary study or prior, did you encounter any obstacles when using MyAI.\\n\\nP2   18:56\\nObstacles. And does advertisements count as obstacle? Because I received like a lot of that.\\n\\nKadir   19:03\\nHmm so.\\n\\nP2   19:05\\nYeah, they were like a lot of extra, but it's advertisements which are not related to my prompts or anything like that. So this has been like annoying. Other than that, I don't think so. I like a little bit of trouble uploading a picture. I don't know why it like took a lot of long time. It took like about one minute to upload a picture, so I think those two are the major things that I did not like or would say obstacles while doing your the diary stories.\\n\\nKadir   19:27\\nMm-hmm. So what makes advertisements? Kind of like annoying for you. Or think you are that they are, they might be obstacle.\\n\\nP2   19:44\\nSo if if the advertisement are like what I'm looking for. So if I'm like if they are like what, how do I put it? So if I see a random advertisement on my screen, so it must be like something related to what I'm trying to say, right to MyAI.\\n\\nKadir   19:58\\nHearing me.\\n\\nP2   19:59\\nBut it is like some random kind of thing, like some magazine covers or something like that.\\nSo which I haven't really talked about it with MyAI then I think that it's like kind of annoying.\\n\\nKadir   20:11\\nOK, OK. Yeah, yeah, definitely. If if it's not related to your purpose, I understand.\\n\\nP2   20:16\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   20:16\\nYep. Uh. So. Do you like? Do you feel like you have access to necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP2   20:29\\nYeah, I think so.\\n\\nKadir   20:31\\nOK. So that's that's fair enough. And have you heard somebody in your circle or environment else talk about MyAI before?\\n\\nP2   20:49\\nWhen, it like first came out. Yes, but after that I don't think like anybody is using it would even though people using Snapchat. So when it first came out, like we were like, kind of, what do you say we were like, trying to see what that was? So it was introduced as your personal assistant on Snapchat first. So before MyAI, I think so it it was introduced as personal assistant.\\nSo I had like few talks with it and also some of my friends did as well. So yeah, but I don't think it's like that, that that used right now.\\n\\nKadir   21:18\\nAnd. OK so.\\n\\nP2   21:22\\nI can't speak for all of all of us, but that's what I think.\\n\\nKadir   21:27\\nOK, so it can be a friend. It can be an acquaintance or a media, so probably you've heard from friends when it came up first. As far as I understand.\\n\\nP2   21:36\\nYeah. Yeah, it's gonna be your friend as well. So as I told you earlier, so when I was stuck once in the airport so I had nothing to do with having to talk with an AI. So yeah, it it did help me at that time. So it can be your friend.\\n\\nKadir   21:48\\nOK. OK.\\n\\nP2   21:49\\nYou're gonna situation, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   21:51\\nYeah. So then yeah, it's more like if you if you, I mean you said for example you might be considering it as a friend or maybe personal assistant. So does this affect anything or how does it, you know affect you communication with with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   22:17\\nSo if you're like trying to like, uh, if you think of it as a friend, I think, and your prompt are what you type into the my hair would be like a lot of a lot friendly. So I think that's the only thing.\\nSo what? What you consider it as if you like. Think of it like a search engine. Or like, uh, yeah, feature that will help you to get some information. So you are prompt would would would be formal and you would like have to like type it in a detail. But if you like using it for fun so it can be like short and like silly kind of prompts because you that depends on the intent of use right?\\n\\nKadir   22:51\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   22:53\\nSo I think there's there's the rest of the difference.\\n\\nKadir   22:57\\nOK. Yeah, so. Have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAI?\\n\\nP2   23:11\\nNo, not exactly MyAI, but like another a lot of other generative AI, so even my professor my advisor tells me to like properly use like ChatGPT or something like that. Other generative AI, but not exactly my Snapchat. Yeah, because I think the demographics are the people using my AI is like kind of like limited to teenagers right now. So they are not the guys who I would take advice with.\\n\\nKadir   23:32\\nUh-huh.\\n\\nP2   23:35\\nSo I think that that.\\n\\nKadir   23:37\\nWell, OK, OK, I got it.\\n\\nP2   23:38\\nWe could.\\n\\nKadir   23:41\\nSo would you recommend trying myAI to your friends?\\n\\nP2   23:49\\nYes, you're I can do that.\\n\\nKadir   23:54\\nAnd why?\\n\\nP2   23:55\\nBut but according to the user's there, according to the uses, if they want to like search for anything specific then I wouldn't like tell them to go to go and search in MyAI because I don't think like it's like that effective.\\n\\nKadir   23:55\\nWhy would you?\\nWhy would you?\\n\\nP2   24:09\\nBut if they just want to have fun, I can like this. Suggest them this. Speak with MyAI in the future. It was one like I can say like that, but if they want like get some information out of MyAI, then I would not recommend it.\\n\\nKadir   24:22\\nOK, OK. And since starting using my I have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\\n\\nP2   24:34\\nNo, no, I I have noticed with I think it is just the same.\\n\\nKadir   24:35\\nGeneral social media habits, I mean. OK. Uh, do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to MyAI?\\n\\nP2   24:52\\nMy uh, yeah, I use like ChatGPT on a daily basis.\\n\\nKadir   24:57\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   24:57\\nAll the other than that, I don't think I have like much explicit experience with other generative AI apps or some like that. I think that ChatGPT is the only one.\\n\\nKadir   25:07\\nOK. Yeah. I asked this but still I wanna ask. Maybe a kind of follow up. What is similar between chat GPT and MyAI or? And what is different in essence?\\n\\nP2   25:25\\nOK. So in essence, OK, so the I think what I feel is like ChatGPT, if you like ask any questions.\\nSo it will like generally it will respond in like formal matters like and I use it like more more for like formal things. So if I have to write to mail and I want to like make like make it like good I ask such as visual change the mail and change the mail to a better format. And if I'm writing a document and I think that my English is a little bit bad, then I asked the charge to change it into kind of like formal or like more scientific terms or write in a better way or for clarity or something like that. So I think it's like more more used in like office kind of work with ChatGPT.\\nUh, for me personally, so actually use this during my thesis.. so during my thesis.\\n\\nI use this use this a lot but MyAI I think it's just like as I said earlier. So I we can use it as a friend.\\nSo if I you don't need to be like that formal it doesn't. It doesn't become that formal with you in the responses, so it's like kind of like friendly chat I felt. So yeah, I think the main difference between that is like my uses, it depends on my users as well.\\n\\nKadir   26:33\\nHmm.\\n\\nP2   26:39\\nSo I use my.\\n\\nKadir   26:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   26:41\\nI use ChatGPT for like a lot of things in my work, but yeah, MyAI not that much.\\n\\nKadir   26:45\\nHmm.\\nUmm uh, yeah, I think this is this is pretty helpful. So I remember you also were telling about you use ChatGPT on your desktop and then MyAI on your phone so.\\n\\nP2   27:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   27:05\\nOther than kind of like categorizing you said ChatGPT, for more formal stuff for more. Maybe professional stuff versus check MyAI, more personal, maybe more lightweight.\\n\\nP2   27:16\\nYes. Yeah.\\n\\nKadir   27:17\\nSo what characteristics? What characteristics of MyAI leads to that kind of like perception or perspective for you?\\n\\nP2   27:32\\nUh, so yeah, if you like, look at some of the things, some of the screenshots. So the way that MyAI reply is, so it's like pretty like informal, if you see uses like worse like oops, my bad something like that.\\n\\nKadir   27:42\\nUh.\\n\\nP2   27:46\\nSo the things that you use and in like daily conversation with the friends and all so and it it is like kind of like what do you say expressive of its emotion? I think so because like it it kind of like if I tell it that it is wrong, then it says like, oops, I'm..I'm so sorry for that. Something like that.\\n\\nKadir   28:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   28:04\\nWe don't see in terms if you did that often, so eventually like give a prompt, then it will just say something formally. So I think this is the main reason why is why I said so.\\n\\nKadir   28:14\\nMore conversational features of language. Uh.\\n\\nP2   28:18\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   28:19\\nSupposed in my AI any have you? I don't know. Like would you like to eligible bit comment on any. Like interface features like any features that MyAI has, make it more personal or versus impersonal.\\n\\nP2   28:39\\nInterface features. Uh, I think it's just like chatting with a friend right in MyAI. So if you if you have seen the interface of my AI so it's like exactly the same as like other Snapchat chats.\\n\\nKadir   28:47\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   28:56\\nAnd so it has like a place to, like, upload your pictures or something like that. Send a sticker, sticker or even like voice memos, which you don't see in ChatGPT.\\n\\nKadir   29:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   29:04\\nSo yeah, I think that all the interface is is it is like making it is like designed to be like your personal friend or assistant like that's what I feel.\\n\\nKadir   29:15\\nOK. OK, definitely indefinitely. That makes sense. So I think you said this, you saw some ads or sponsored content while interacting with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   29:30\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nKadir   29:30\\nAnd then you're feeling was OK. I'm skipping this question because you already kind of responded to that, sorry. So in terms of in your conversation with my I, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP2   29:51\\nReliable.\\n\\nKadir   29:52\\nYeah. Do you think the responses from my AI have reliable they are.\\n\\nP2   29:57\\nSo far I don't think I can see that I can answer this question right now because I haven't like cross checked, but it uh answered me because I actually to like give me an itinerary with all the pricing and the budgeting. But I haven't like looked into how accurate that was really. But I know from the fact that it gave me like wrong information on the soccer fields, so I would say not that reliable.\\n\\nKadir   30:21\\nHmm. Yeah. With soccer cleats I? When I looked at your screenshots, umm for all the options it was offering giving the same price right?\\n\\nP2   30:33\\nYeah, I I told it like it. My budget is like $150.00 and give me a price range for all of the soccer cleats, but I think it it all showed the same pricing like $150.00 for everything yeah.\\n\\nKadir   30:47\\nAnd then it's kind of like a question mark, I I see, like I, yeah, so you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI, for example, I've seen a you you share your picture with the chat, but what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by MyAI on Snapchat or by Snapchat let's say?\\n\\nP2   30:49\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, I I couldn't get the last part like that. Good. Can you like repeat that again?\\n\\nKadir   31:20\\nSure you shared. Let me quickly be we're waiting. You might have shared something personal when interacting with the my AI chat bot and what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by Snapchat.\\n\\nP2   31:38\\nUsed by Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   31:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   31:42\\nI don't think I have, like, ever thought of thought it. So what I think what do you want me to say in that regard? If my information or like pictures are used by the Snapchat itself, the Snapchat app or like my AI in a different way, is like going to be what you say public on the Internet or something like that. I couldn't get the question completely so.\\n\\nKadir   32:08\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   32:41\\nOK, it's alright. Yeah, I'm not that concerned because all everything like you say right now or in the modern day world like they know it all, I think so they can like hear us like through our phones. And so if you look at the ads given by Facebook is like kind of even if I speak in [home country language] with my friend, it kind of latches onto that and shows me the air of the same thing in Facebook.\\n\\nKadir   33:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   33:11\\nSo I think our data is being like sold everywhere right now. So I I don't mind. I don't mind it.\\nI..I'm not that concerned about it.\\n\\nKadir   33:26\\nOK, I think I this is totally fair. I think this kind of brings us to the end of our conversation. Do you have anything at the very end to add or to emphasize before we hung up?\\n\\nP2   33:44\\nNo, not really. \\n\\nP2   35:08\\nNice to meet you, buddy.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   35:11\\nOK, I'll stop the recording.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nNice to meet you too.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P5_Interview\\nMarch  27, 2024\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:05\\nCan you please tell me a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP5 0:19\\nUh, so I'm P5. I'm from Nepal and I'm currently a freshman here in ISU from Biology department.\\n\\nShristi 0:27\\nSo can you tell me what social media platforms you use currently?\\n\\nP5 0:36\\nI use a lot of social media platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok\\n\\nShristi 0:46\\nSo do you remember when you did you start using Snapchat?\\n\\nP5 0:51\\nYeah. And that was really long ago, I think. I think I started using it since like 2017 or 18.\\n\\nShristi 1:00\\nSo maybe when you were a high schooler, high schooler?\\n\\nP5 1:04\\nNo. When I was in Grade 7 or 8.\\n\\nShristi 1:06\\nOh, so you were in in middle school?\\n\\nP5 1:08\\nYeah, but like I didn't not use it to interact with people, but just to like take snaps and like picture.\\n\\nShristi 1:15\\nOhh I know for the filters.\\n\\nP5 1:18\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi 1:18\\nYeah. Interesting. Yeah, I used to do that too when I was in.\\n\\nP5 1:21\\nYeah, I did that.I just started using it for like interacting with people since I was in grade 11.\\n\\nShristi 1:28\\nOhh great 11. That's interesting. Yeah, I really used to like some filters on Instagram.\\n\\nP5 1:34\\nYeah.The one with the flowers and it.\\n\\nShristi 1:37\\nOhh yeah, I know what you mean.\\n\\nShristi 1:37\\nOK, so currently, what do you do the most on in on Snapchat?\\n\\nP5 1:47\\nUmm, so I love taking snaps. I love taking pictures and the filters are like so good nowadays.And the other thing is I love to maintain streaks with my friends. So if this streaks is gonna like end, I'm gonna like call him or text him saying have and I. And I. Sometimes I talk to them like it's private, so I think I use the Snapchat for more personal and private conversations because it just like goes away in a day.\\n\\nShristi 2:18\\nYeah, makes sense. Did you use the Snapchat in my AI feature before this study?\\n\\nP5 2:30\\nYeah, I did.\\n\\nShristi 2:31\\nOK. So can you tell me when and why you started using it in the past?\\n\\nP5 2:36\\nOh, I don't know. I just like it was new to me. I didn't know it existed, but like it one day it suddenly appeared. So I was just like watching Tik Toks and like people were sharing screenshots about what they're talking and I wanted to try it. So I just like started talking to it and I don't know, I wanted to try if it knows various languages. So I started talking to the AI in Nepali and it did know Nepali language. I just.had fun. I used to like say so random things to the AI and it yeah, it just used to respond. I loved it.\\n\\nShristi 3:19\\nSo can you give me an example of how you have used this feature my AI? It can be an example from the study or it can be something outside of it.\\n\\nP5 3:32\\nUmm, I think I use it when I need like recommendations. When I'm going to a new place and I don't know what I'm gonna do, like if I'm hungry or something and I don't know where to eat, I just open Snapchat and ask it like, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 3:38\\nOK, so do you also use the recommendation that it makes?\\n\\nP5 3:55\\nYeah, I do. It sends me like four or five recommendations. So I check the all of them and then I just go to some place with higher reviews.\\n\\nShristi 4:07\\nUmm so. How frequently do you think you have used my AI? Have you used it multiple times or have you tried it like once or twice?\\n\\nP5 4:21\\nUh, when it first came, I used to like talk to almost like, twice or thrice a week, whenever I feel felt bored. But now I don't use it much because I don't have time. \\n\\nShristi 4:49\\nI think you have found my AI useful for recommendations. So is there anything else you have found my AI useful for?\\n\\nP5 4:55\\nUh, I think when I really do like vent something when I'm mad or like when I'm sad about something and I don't wanna talk to it about anyone else, I just try to talk to the AI because obviously it doesn't, you know, like it doesn't share my information to anybody and all. So when I do that I I think I like it because it it sends me like so many positive messages which I think helps me to cheer up my mood.\\n\\nShristi 5:24\\nUmm, yeah, yeah, I think I could get where you're coming from? Because I think if you talk about it, you share it with something. So it's just you talking to the AI. I think the will go away after a while, so I think it's more.\\n\\nP5 5:41\\nAnd also when I'm like not feeling pretty, I just what I do is I just send my snap or like a picture to the AI and it's like you're so pretty. You're you're looking amazing and all. And I feel good. So yeah.\\n\\nShristi 5:57\\nHmm you like the AI hyping you off. \\n\\nP5 5:59\\nYeah, I like it.\\n\\nShristi 6:00\\nCan you share me an experience where you found that my AI met your expectations?\\n\\nP5 6:17\\nI think it actually like does meet my expectations, like all the time, because when I really need a recommendation, when I really need to know what things I need to do here. Like if I don't know anything about a place or or if I don't know anything about a certain food, whether I should like, try it or not, then when I asked the AI it just like gives everything. What I need to know, so I think it does like carry out on my like expectations so.\\n\\nShristi 6:51\\nOK, sounds good. So can you share me an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations?\\n\\nP5 7:02\\nOhh that was when I that was like before this study. I think I was back in Nepal at that time and I needed to like go to someplace new in Kathmandu itself. But when I asked the AI about it, it was showing me exact same thing like all the time. It was showing me like four or five places. But I actually needed to know new places, but it was just showing me the common ones [in Kathmandhu]. I already knew about it. I already went there.I didn't like it wanted to tell me those things.\\n\\nShristi 7:42\\nUh, so I think it was just repeating the same five places that everybody knows about in Kathmandu..\\n\\nP5 7:50\\nYeah, it was just repeating all the time.\\n\\nShristi 7:52\\nSo your intention, I think for asking that would be finding new places that maybe you know like it's not known by everybody.\\n\\nP5 7:57\\nYeah, like if I ask it for the first time and it shows something, uh, I don't want it to show the same thing the second time or the third time.\\n\\nShristi 8:13\\nI know what you mean because like if it shows if you're telling it to do something new and if it's throwing you the same thing and you will get, yeah, it can get frustrating.\\n\\n\\nShristi 8:21\\nThank you for sharing that. So in general, because I think you have used my AI for quite a long time and I think you use it regularly, even outside of the study. So in your opinion, how much effort do you think using my AI needs?\\n\\nP5 8:43\\nI don't think it needs much effort because you can just steal it like anything you wanted. It understands, but sometimes what it does is you're talking about a certain topic and and you know, like if I ask if I'm asking you about something and it says another thing and I am asking the about the same topic but a different thing like a different thing about the exact same topic that we were talking about before. What it does is it like suddenly changes the topic.\\n\\nShristi 9:17\\nUmm, I think you know what you mean. I think one of the screenshots that you have uploaded when you were playing the game with it. So you go off to a tangent and talk about something else and you want to complete the game with it has forgotten about it, uh.\\n\\nP5 9;24\\nYeah, it just like completely jumps off to another topic and it's hard. Like I don't wanna explain something again and again to it like I it's. I don't like typing. I don't even like send text to my parents because I don't like typing at all.But when it does that, it just gets frustrating because I don't wanna explain it to like explain the same thing again and again.\\n\\nShristi 9:54\\nYeah, makes sense. So in terms of any skill set that is required to use my AI well, do you think there are any skills that are needed?\\n\\nP5 10:07\\nI don't think it's that important, but I think you need to like know how to actually carry on the conversation like you need to know what you're talking about, because it might suddenly change the topics and it might give you some advices which are not related to it. And if you don't know what you're talking about, it might take a completely different turn.\\n\\nShristi 10:36\\nUmm, so it's it's more about OK how do you post the questions and how do you reply to it?\\n\\nP5 10:45\\nYep. And sometimes it is like if the structure of the sentence doesn't like match to what you're trying to say, it just answers you about like completely different thing.\\n\\nShristi 11:00\\nSo. I'm taking it as is, you know, like you should have like basic English writing skills. It understands you well.\\n\\nP5 11:11\\nYou should have the knowledge of grammars.\\n\\nShristi 11:13\\nMakes sense. OK, so for using the my AI chat bot will do you think you have the necessary skills or know-how on how to get get it to. So do you have the skills or know-how to make it work well?\\n\\nP5 11:42\\nYeah, I think I do. I usually talk a lot, like even to people, so I don't think it's hard for me to talk to the AI because when  I open Snapchat and I decide to talk to the AI, I pretty much know what I want to talk about and what answers I want. So even if it answers me wrong or like even if it tells me about something else, I just tell it like, no, I don't mean this. I want to know about something else and you're wrong. So I think after that it gives me the answer that I want.\\n\\nShristi 12:18\\nOK, so you're usually not dropping the conversation, but you are just giving it enough context to give you the right answers.\\n\\nP5 12:26\\nYeah. I just asked something which I want to know about like except the recommendations things for recommendation. I don't know about anything, so I just ask it, but for other things I think I just ask it what I want to know. Like I want the confirmation that what I'm doing is right.\\n\\nShristi 12:48\\nUmm, so I think you talked about one obstacle already, which is it forgetting about what conversation you were having and going somewhere else. But apart from that, do you have you found other obstacles when you were trying to talk with my AI?\\n\\nP5 13:07\\nI don't think there are much obstacles. Yeah, I remember one thing. So whenever like I talked to him, I I talked to AI about something. It just sends me a paragraph like a whole paragraph. It's like 5-6 sentences and that's like I don't wanna read it like I just want one sentence. I just want a clear answer and it sends me so much I think, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 13;37\\nOh yeah, I know what you mean, because I think it on the phone, it looks very difficult to reed when they have like a para.\\n\\nP5 13:44\\nYeah, not like, very difficult, but even if it's like short things, even if it's two sentences or three sentences, it looks like a big paragraph in the phone because they screen is small. So it looks quite like intermediating to even read it because it looks so big. I don't wanna read it. I hate reading stuff and I like it.\\n\\nShristi 14:07\\nThat totally makes sense. Yeah, I do remember one other thing that happened with you. I think in the shopping task where you asked, I think something about iPhone 15 and it said it didn't exist. So what do you think about that?\\n\\nP5 14:20\\nI didn't know that it didn't know because I thought it's like computer viz. So like it has to have every single information like every new information, right? So I thought it knew already, but when I asked about it, it was like it hasn't even released it and I was like, what do you mean? They're gonna release iphone 16! I was shocked that it didn't know.\\n\\nShristi 14:46\\nOK, so when when that happened, do you like, did you like tell it that? Ohh, they're releasing it? Or or did you just like drop the conversation?\\n\\nP5 14:57\\nI I didn't ask it because at that time I was like, so sleepy. I didn't wanna like talk. I didn't wanna send anything else, like I didn't want to hold on the conversation for too long, and I knew if I did that, if I asked that question, it was gonna be long. So I didn't ask about it. Yeah, I didn't wanna explain.\\n\\nShristi 15:13\\nOK, so you didn't wanna take the trouble of explaining and and uh, OK, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 15:19\\nYeah, I didn`t wanna explain. \\n\\nShristi 15:22\\nUM and four UM, I think just as you said, there are some times when problems arise when you're using it, it forgets the conversation or it does not have the details. Or sometimes it might give the you know wrong information, so when that happens, do you feel you have access to any necessary resources or support to use it properly?\\n\\nP5 15:36\\nSo like in the MyAI, like in the Snapchat itself or outside it?\\n\\nShristi 15:40\\nIn the Snapchat itself or or somewhere outside where you can look up information.\\n\\nP5 15:44\\nUmm, I think it like when it does that. I think I go directly to Google and ask it, but sometimes when I ask the AI about the same thing like the thing that it got wrong, I think it like apologizes and says like I'm gonna search for it again and it sends me the correct information in third time or something. But I like to. I like to go to Google and search it because I don't trust it.\\n\\nShristi 16:17\\nSo I think you've already umm, I think touched on it a little bit that you saw TikToks  about, you know, people talking with my AI when it first came out. So in addition to the TikToks, have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet.\\n\\nP5 16:41\\nYeah, I have. I think my most of my friends use it sometimes, like not regularly but sometimes and before I told them they didn't actually use it. But when I told them that it also knows other languages and if you want to talk, talk to the AI in your own language, I think you can do it so like they tried it and they loved it too, like when we're bored or something like that. We just go to AI and ask those stupid things.\\n\\nShristi\\nSo so for the AI, have you for the AI, I think yes, you encouraged other people, but have you ever been encouraged by other people to use my AI? Or it could be something that other people posted. What did you use end up using my AI because of the Tik Toks?\\n.\\nP5 17:06\\nYeah, like nobody particularly told me to use it. I just used it because I saw some videos and it looked like fun, so yeah.\\n\\nShristi 17:46\\nSo for you are so because I think you have been using it for a certain period of time already. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habit after you started using my AI?\\n\\nP5 18:07\\nUh, not much, but I think when I because now I haven't, like, used it as much as I did before. I don't have free time, but I still use other social media so I don't know it just when I just talked to my AI it makes me forget about other things. So I just keep using the AI and then I sleep on time. So I like that about it. I think yeah, it just makes me forget about everything. Everything else does not know the Instagram, the Facebook and everything else. I just forget that they exist.\\n\\nShristi 18:49\\nUmm, so it's more like you know when you're trying to sleep, but you still wanna like scroll through the feeds or talk to other people. It's it's something that you talk to instead of doing other things so that you can slowly fall asleep. Is that what you're saying?\\n\\nP5 19:03\\nYeah. Yeah, sometimes I do that because talking to my AI is like sometimes it's boring. So if if I ask about some educational things or something to it, it start explaining everything and I feel so bored. I just. I just think no, I'd rather sleep. So I just like close my phone and I sleep.\\n\\nShristi 19:25\\nThat's that's, I think the most creative thing I've heard trying to sleep trying to get help for sleeping with my. That's cool.\\n\\nP5 19:35\\nBecause I can. I can literally not sleep. I tried everything. If I start scrolling, I just keep scrolling it until it's two or three, and even when I try to sleep, uh, with some music on, I started dancing. So I'd rather use that. I just could not sleep with music on so.\\n\\nShristi 20:03\\nOK, I I know what you mean because I think because for some people try to put music on and then just dose off. But then you love the music so much that you just going along with the songs.\\n\\nP5 20:13\\nYeah, like I. Also, because like I normally don't do music I I don't listen to music all the time. But when I do listen to music, I just love listening to it and I keep listening to it unless I cannot. So I just cannot sleep and yeah, and when I when I try to learn about some educational things, I just fell asleep. Like I don't want to study so definitely I feel I feel sleepy and then I just decide. No, I'd rather sleep.\\n\\nShristi 20:46\\nSo have you been using or have used in the past something that is similar to my AI?\\n\\nP5 20:56\\nThere's like ChatGPT. Makes sense?\\n\\nShristi 21:02\\nYeah, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 21:04\\nI've used that I've used that. I use it even now, but I don't trust it like at all. It gave me wrong answers like so many times.\\n\\nShristi 21:15\\nChatGPT or MyAI?\\n\\nP5 21:18\\nChat GPT\\n\\nShristi 21:21\\nOK! So did it  give you wrong answers for like academic stuff?\\n\\nP5 21:24\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi 21:25\\nYeah, totally makes sense when it like, confidently gives you the wrong answer. You don't even know about it. Yeah.\\n\\nP5 21:27\\nNowadays what I do is like a first Snapchat. I just talk to you about personal stuff like or something that's happening to me or something fun. But for academic stuff, I just use chat GPT in place of SnapChat, because I just think that makes more sense. I don't know why, but nowadays I'm like if I ask one question to the chat GPT I asked him the same question twice to make sure because I don't trust it at all. it made so many mistakes. So what I do is I ask the question and answers me and I and I said like Are you sure? And it's like it, it does it again and then it gets something. And then I and then again this really correct and then it gives me another answer. So I don't trust it.\\n\\nShristi 22:38\\nOK, so you just make sure by giving it like by making it a try for like multiple times so that you know you got the right answer. OK, makes sense.\\n\\nP5 22:43\\nYeah, sometimes even that is wrong.\\n\\nShristi 22:46\\nOK, so yeah, connecting to that in your experience, do you feel that there are some similarities between my AI and ChatGPT?\\n\\nP5 23:03\\nYeah, there are similarities. Like they both answer to you, if you have some questions you  just ask it to like both of like Snapchat, my AI and the chat GPT and it just answers you. I think that's the similar thing. Yeah, it's the same. Not not act exactly same, but it is similar.\\n\\nShristi 23:28\\nSo what do you think are the differences between my AI versus ChatGPT?\\n\\nP5 23:39\\nI think for ChatGPT is like more it's. I don't know. I think it's serious like because it doesn't have, you know, it's it's technically made for academic stuff. So I think that's more sophisticated. I don't know if that's the right word, but yeah. But, MyAI is so chill; we can use We can use emojis with it.  We can we can use anything. It's like more fun and personal, so if you ask me I when I have to talk about myself or like something I need or or something personal, I would choose MyAI. But if I have to learn about something or if I have to ask questions about academic stuff and educational stuff. I would rather use ChatGPT.\\n\\nShristi 24:37\\nUmm, so when you are talking with MyAI,  have you ever seen ads or sponsored content?\\n\\nP5 24:47\\nYeah. Once or twice, not not much, but I have seen him once or twice because when I ask when I ask about recommendations, sometimes what it does it like it sends uh, you know, first what? I don't know if it's it can be called add or not, but uh it sends me like four or five recommendations and for one of them it also sends like the whole poster thing.\\n\\nShristi 25:15\\nOhh OK, so it sounds you extra information?\\n\\nP5 25:17\\nNot extra information, but like, especially when uh asking over like restaurants or brands or something first, I don't know, like it it doesn't do it all the time, but sometimes what it does is it is it sends you know the like poster of the restaurant thing like with menus sometime menus and all and the prices and everything. It doesn't do it for every everything, but sometimes I don't know what happens. It just sends like randomly like random restaurant.\\n\\nShristi 26:00\\nUmm, OK, so when you are talking with it and you suddenly see a sponsored content or like an ad, so how does that usually make you feel?\\n\\nP5 26:01\\nI don't think it's like that bad because it's not like the YouTube ads or something. It just sends it and it forgets about it. So like the topic gets carried on, so I don't think it does much. Yeah, I don't think it even matters.\\n\\nShristi 26:25\\nI think we have talked about the trust thing related to ChatGPT already, but connecting it more to MyAI. How reliable do you find the responses by my AI?\\n\\nP5 26:48\\nI think it's quite like when I need personal like suggestions or I even talked to it when I'm kind of feeling low because it just like hikes me up suddenly and it gives so many positive affirmations. So I think it's quite reliable, especially for people who are feeling like low, who are kind of in the verse of, you know, going into depression or something. I think it and it answers you in such a way that it makes you feel validated and like it makes you feel like you are, you know, you're not wrong. I don't know it's reliable in that aspect, but for some aspect like for umm, if you ask certain like questions specific questions which has like specific answers to it, sometimes it does give you wrong answers.\\n\\nShristi 27:28\\nOK, so for example, if you're, I don't know, like looking for a place recommendations or maybe yeah, just the phone thing, right. It got it wrong. So for those kinds of tasks. So if for example you need to like find place of like plan a trip or buy something, do you trust MyAI`s  responses related to those tasks?\\n\\nP5 28:12\\nYeah, most of the time, I do trust it, but sometimes what I like to do is search it up and, like, ask to the MyAI and then go to the Google and search about it by myself. Like because some of them information might be wrong. Yeah, let's say 80%, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 28:30\\nSo so you just, OK, so you use the MyAI  responses as like the starting point and do your own research, yeah.\\n\\nP5 28:38\\nYeah, because I just, I I just don't think that I can go to a certain place that it recommended without looking for like anything else because that might be anything I might not like it or something. So I trusted but like not 100%.\\n\\nShristi 29:01\\nUmm, so building on the trust thing because I am so you might have shared something personal or or you might do it on a regular basis when you share a personal things with MyAI. So what are your concerns if there are any regarding the information that you are sharing is used by the company or  just Snapchat in general?\\n\\nP5 29:33\\nSo I'm type of person who's open to sharing everything? Like I don't mind if everybody knows what's going on in my life. I just feel like sometimes, even when I'm like, feeling very low or, you know, I just carry on with my life and I think sharing that thing with other people might make them inspired or something, you know, like, just make them feel like they're not alone in that. So I don't mind if my information is used by the company, but like I'm sometimes I'm also scared that the personal matters that I shared with Might be like publicized or something. I just sometimes it's just like random thoughts.\\n\\nShristi 30:25\\nUmm, so when you were just being the devil's advocate and just imagining the worst case possible.\\n\\nP5 30:27\\nYeah, I'm scared of that thing. But I still like I don't share like very, very, very important things with MyAI. But the things which are I think OK, even if it gets publicized or something, I just share those stuff.\\n\\nShristi 30:50\\nSo yeah, uh, those where the prospective questions that I had. Thank you so much for answering everything so much in detail. So before we leave, do you have anything to talk about in MyAI which you think we left in our conversation?\\n\\nP5 31:12\\nI don't know, but I think, yeah, I realized one thing that like when I when I asked about like recommendation for a filter it sends me like so bad filter like that was bad.\\n\\nShristi 31:22\\nOhh I do remember it. Ohh I thought I would ask you about it. So I think you told it like ohh I don't like this culture or something. And then it opt apologize.\\n\\nP5 31:37\\nYeah, like it was not bad. I liked the filter but I don't wanna use the dog filter all the time. I mean, I know about it. I just don't wanna use it. It's like childish or something. We just use it for fun. When when we would like small children, I just. I didn't like it.\\n\\nShristi 31:56\\nThat was liking the first filter that was super popular.\\n\\nP5 32:05\\nYeah. And when I said can you send me something else? I don't like it. It sent me another filter which is the same thing like the dog filter itself.\\n\\nShristi 32:11\\nOhh OK, so it was the same filter.\\n\\nP5 32:14\\nYeah, I felt like it was obsessed with dogs. I don't think, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 32:21\\nMakes sense. Yeah, I think that that could be like one of the experiences where you're like it's not, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 32:32\\nOK. So yeah, thank you so much for being a part of the interview.\\n\\n\", \"Transcript P4_Interview\\nMarch 25, 2024\\n\\nShristi 0:06\\nOK, it's the recording has started.\\nSo I'll just first start with a few warm-up questions.\\nLet's just get comfortable around each other.\\nSo for that, can you tell me a little bit about yourself first?\\n\\n\\nP4 0:22\\nYeah! My name is Jacob. I'm a sophomore at Iowa State. I'm studying math education.\\nI like music. I'm in the marching band here, and I like to play basketball for fun.\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:35\\nOhh it's great. Thank you so much.\\nSo Jacob, what social media platforms do you use?\\n\\n\\nP4 0:47\\nI would say pretty regularly I use Snapchat and Instagram and then on occasion I use TikTok.\\n\\n\\nShristi 0:54\\nOK. Do you remember when you started using Snapchat?\\n\\n\\nP4 1:02\\nProbably sometime in middle school, so that would probably be about six or seven years ago.\\n\\n\\nShristi 1:09\\nOK, so since you are even a frequent user right now, so can you tell me what do you do most on Snapchat?\\n\\nP4 1:17\\nI send pictures to friends or like it's pretty easy to message a friend and I I do really like the feature of making group chats on Snapchat and that's pretty convenient for like a group project and stuff like that.\\n\\n\\nShristi 1:29\\nOK, so do you also collaborate with your, I don`t know, colleagues like friends from task to do projects as well?\\n\\nP4 1:38\\nYes.\\n\\nShristi 1:40\\nOK. I had never heard of that before. Just making sure I got it right. So have you ever used the Snapchat   MyAI feature before taking part in this study?\\n\\nP4 1:57\\nYes, I have. It was mainly just the kind of like test to see what it could do, like I didn't do like anything like as intricate as the study required, But I have like messed with it a little bit before.\\n\\n\\nShristi 2:07\\nUmm, OK. So do you remember when you first played with it or tried it using it?\\n\\nP4 2:14\\nYeah, I kind of did similar stuff like like I would do to ChatGPT which is like I was seeing how you could like test it with prompts like for example one time I asked a question and I said like only responding emojis is to see how he would try to do that. It's like just stuff like play with it. Nothing like super in depth.\\n\\nShristi 2:34\\nSo moving on, so can you tell me or show me an example of how you used Snapchat MyAI? you can talk about something that you did as a part of this study or something outside of it.\\n\\n\\nP4 2:50\\nSomething I did for this study was to get travel recommendations for like a three-day trip and I like one of the things I could do to, like, narrow down the prompt. Once I initially asked was like give my location and like give a pricing. If I thought like a hotel was too expensive, I kind of asked like are there any cheaper options and it referred me to the cheaper options. And what I liked about it was it showed you like like a, you know, like the like, the global Snapchat stories people can upload it and showed you that of that hotel. So you could see like actually what the inside of the hotel looked like and what was going on at the time.\\n\\n\\nShristi 3:20\\nUh-huh. So you could see what other people snapped about the place?\\n\\n\\nP4 3:32\\nYes, like if it gave you location, there was like a little circle, you could click on.I think it took a screenshot of it and sent it and it would open like the like the public stories people would post. So you could see like them like showing Snapchat stories like at that hotel or in the area. So if there's like a festival or event going on, you could like see what's actually happening.\\n\\nShristi 3:53\\nOh, that's cool. I didn't know about that, actually. That's great.\\n\\nShristi 3:56\\nSo the travel recommendation thing that you did, would it be similar to things that you would generally do on MyAI?\\n\\nP4 4:12\\nOhh like are you saying? Like what? I actually like to use it for travel travel recommendations like in my own time.\\n\\nShristi 4:17\\nSo is it do you think that certain example depicts what you usually do on MyAI?\\n\\nP4 4:26\\nI would say prior to the study, no, just because I didn't really know how useful it would be, but like looking back now, I would like going on in the future. But I would say previously I would not have thought about doing that.\\n\\n\\nShristi 4:35\\nOK, so based on any interaction that you did as a part of the study or maybe something outside of it, have you ever found MyAI to be useful?\\n\\nP4 4:51\\nPrior to the study, I would say no, I didn't use it in depth like say just  Googling something or ChatGPT, so I didn't really know the capabilities before the study.\\n\\nShristi 5:05\\nMakes sense! So after the study, do you think there might be use cases for you for MyAI in the coming future?\\n\\n\\nP4 5:15\\nYeah, like I really did like the convenience of it. And I do like cooking and I think I mentioned that it would be pretty easy to ask like, how do I substitute this for recipe or like pretty easy to live ask it a specific question without having to Google and filter through results.\\n\\nShristi 5:33\\nCan you share an experience where you felt MyAI meet your expectations?\\n\\nP4 5:52\\nI would say just like with the trivia game, it did. It was pretty straightforward. It was just like I asked it to, like, give me a I think it was Star Wars trivia and it like gave an answer or get, gave a question with four different answers in multiple choice. It was pretty straightforward.\\n\\nShristi 6:08\\nSo when you say straightforward, what do you like about the interaction that happened during the game?\\n\\n\\nP4 6:20\\nUmm, when you gave an answer, if it was wrong, it would like explain why it gave context instead of like just like instantly giving you like what was right what was wrong. I liked how it kind of explained, and at once there was one point that was kind of confusing, and I asked it to explain, and it did explain like quite a bit more than just like otherwise I'd have to like Google it and like figure it on my own. But I did like how it it explained it pretty well.\\n\\n\\nShristi 6:45\\nCan you share an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations?\\n\\nP4 6:56\\nI would say umm. I asked it for like the three-day trip that was a prompt. I asked it for travel directions and like I I gave where I was like I said, Ames, IA and it couldn't give like directions. it said it for some reason it didn't have my location, which I was kind of confused because I thought like, you know, Snapchat gonna has your location. So you would have to use an external app and like it recommended apps to use, but it couldn't itself give you directions.\\n\\n\\nShristi 7:29\\nYeah, I saw that interaction in one of your screen captures. So when you said you thought Snapchat usually has your location, so because there is a setting where you can turn it on or off. So for yours, have you turned on the location setting for Snapchat?\\n\\nP4 7:49\\nYes, because like that I know. Like there's like that Snapmap feature in mine is on.\\n\\nShristi  7:54\\nOK. Thank you for clearing that up. So when you were using MyAI for the four days during the study, or even beyond that in general, how much effort do you think was required to use MyAI?\\n\\nP4 8:13\\nUh, not much. Because like most of the stuff was like pretty general, I think sometimes you kind of had to narrow it down to like if you wanted like a more specific response. But that's like really on you if you want, like like a specific category like like I was saying with like a hotel, like a cheaper hotel. You kinda have to specify that, but I would say overall you don't have to like put that much effort into it.\\n\\n\\nShristi 8:34\\nSo when you say it was not much effort, why do you think it was not a lot of effort, even if you had to narrow down what you were asking a lot of times or maybe switch up what questions you were asking, why do you think it was not a lot of effort?\\n\\n\\nP4 8:55\\nBecause like where it differs versus like Google is like holds on like what you were just talking about. And I think like the context of what you're previous prompt was, it holds that over. So I don't have to like restate something. Like it'll kind of like think like of like about base and what you already said like how to narrow down more. So I think with the how I use this context as why it's easier than like a Googling something.\\n\\n\\nShristi 9:20\\nYeah, that that makes it helpful for me to understand. So do you think that anybody you needed any special skills for using MyAI well?\\n\\n\\nP4 9:37\\nThere might be some skill into like getting a very specific prompt, but overall is pretty intuitive and like I think you could even like ask it for help on how to use it effectively and probably answer that well, but overall I did not. I'm not super like tech knowledgeable and I didn't have any difficulty with it.\\n\\nShristi 9:56\\nSo when you are using MyAI, did you face any obstacles that you encountered?\\n\\n\\nP4 10:13\\nIt's not a big obstacle, but there is the whole location thing and it couldn't give me directions. And I think one time during the trivia game, it did actually like mess up which answer was correct? But that was it. And I wanna say, those weren't really obstacles because like it didn't really like ruin the experience at all. So overall, I wouldn't say there weren't really, really many obstacles at all.\\n\\n\\nShristi 10:36\\nUmm, so when you found that MyAI got confused with the trivia question, do you remember how you attempted to resolve the problem?\\n\\n\\nP4 11:02\\nYeah, I believe I responded and said I was pretty sure it should be like this other answer, and then like, I think my response with ohh like yeah like upon like looking into it more like yeah that's correct. Like I apologize for my mistake and it kind of like corrected itself.\\n\\nShristi 11:17\\nSo I do remember there was that this interaction was quite interesting for me when when you remember when I think it was the third day activity where you had to like stand stickers and pictures and you had sent the dragon one and and you kept telling the AI this is this character from Mario. Don't you, like, recognize this?\\n\\n\\nP4 11:38\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 11:39\\nAnd then you send a picture like the sticker again and it it does not recognize at all.\\n\\nP4 11:44\\nYes, yeah.\\n\\nShristi 11:46\\nDid you feel any, you know, discomfort or problem when the interactions were going in that direction at the time?\\n\\nP4 11:56\\nOK, I'm glad you got that. You brought that up because I totally forgot about that. But yeah, like I was impressed with how like it recognizes like a photo very well. Like if you send like a selfie like it'll be like, oh, like I see it's night or like it can tell, like, very well, it's going on in the background. But the stickers, like it was just a picture. Yeah, Bowser from Mario and like at first, it didn't recognize it. And I said Ohh, it's Bowser and it's like, uh, like, yeah, I know what that is. And like like you were saying, I kept resending it just like did not recognize that no matter how many times I sent it. So I don't know. I wouldn't say it was discomfort, but I just kind of like I was surprised that it's able to pick up like a photo background so well, but it can't pick up the sticker very well at all.\\n\\n\\nShristi 12:33\\nYeah, I think maybe because it's asserting character. Maybe. Yeah, that's something interesting to look into, for sure. So when you were using MyAI, did you feel like you had access to necessary resources or support to use MyAI properly?\\n\\n\\nP4 12:57\\nYeah, I think so. I think it's pretty like, well contained. We're like it can answer your own questions very well. I did like how like on certain prompts it would give you like good follow-up questions. You could just click on and it would ask it for you and answer right away and like on the occasional time like with the directions it would refer you to like a better application that you could use. So I would say overall it's pretty useful and like even if it doesn't have like the right resource, it can like refer you pretty well.\\n\\nShristi 13:19\\nOK, so when so I think for the study we did tell you about it and we asked you to use it, but apart from us, have you have you heard somebody else talk about MyAI, it could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet?\\n\\n\\nP4 13:51\\nJust when you was very new, like when it was first coming out, people were talking about it and like using an A lot and like seeing what they could do with it. But that's really the only time I've heard of like people I know using it.\\n\\nShristi 14:04\\nSo had there been anybody who encouraged you to, you know, like use the tool?\\nIt might be someone who said something to you personally, or maybe you saw people talking about it on the Internet, telling people who use MyAI.\\n\\nP4 14:25\\nI hadn't heard my friends like about this, but I I think I saw somewhere online that like after like the photo feature was like kind of unable to was cool like to see like how it responded like certain pictures like I saw that and I was interested so like I would send it like random pictures of like maybe like a forest near me in different stuff like I would see what it would say to that and it's pretty interesting to see how like how well it was at like describing the photo you would send.\\n\\n\\nShristi 14:51\\nSo when you first tried MyAI, when it first came out, did you try it? You know, because I think Snapchat sent push notifications and like a message to everybody about, hey, this is a new feature we have. So did you try it because of that? Or maybe because you saw other people doing it.\\n\\n\\nP4 15:15\\nI never remember getting a push notification, but I do remember like other people using it to like that made me wanna try it out. So I'd say, yeah, from other people.\\n\\n\\nShristi 15:24\\nSo after using it, you know for a few days based on what you've interacted with, would you recommend other people to try using MyAI?\\n\\n\\nP4 15:41\\nYeah, I think I would. I think this study definitely made me realize, like how actually like, useful and versatile it can be. And I think for like like the different prompts you gave or are good examples. And like, it's funny, like even like the other day, I kind of asked, like, where's like a good restaurant to eat like, that was independent from the study and actually give me a a good, a good response and actually went to that restaurant. I recommend. It was really good.\\n\\n\\nShristi 16:04\\nSo in addition to looking for restaurants, have you, you know, found yourself using MyAI apart from our study?\\n\\nP4 16:17\\nUh, not yet, but I'm sure in the future I will.\\n\\nShristi 16:20\\nOK so after using MyAI, have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\\n\\n\\nP4 16:33\\nI'm not sure 'cause I like I said it hasn't been that long since the study. So I would say like, not too. I haven't noticed a big difference, I would say.\\n\\nShristi 16:44\\nOK, makes sense. So do you think you have used in the past or are currently using something that is similar to MyAI?\\n\\n\\nP4 16:58\\nYes, I have used ChatGPT before.\\n\\nShristi 17:01\\nOK, so when you are using a chat GPT versus when you are using MyAI, do you feel there are any similarities between the two tools?\\n\\nP4 17:16\\nI think definitely like in responses. I do notice like the structure of responses are pretty similar and you can kind of like tell ohh this is likely AI generated and like I think like you know it's very similar to like how you like input a prompt in that response. So I'd say they're pretty similar in that aspect.\\n\\n\\nShristi 17:36\\nAnd going further from the similarity is, do you recognize any story differences between the two applications?\\n\\n\\nP4 17:49\\nI think definitely like the Snapchat one was distinct in like the Snapmap feature. And like how it how it utilizes like Snapchat's own features. Or you can like send in a photo and stuff like that whereas it's like ChatGPT is pretty separate and it's like just like the text aspect of it. So let's say that's a big difference.\\n\\n\\nShristi 18:09\\nWhile you were interacting with MyAI, did you see any ads or sponsored content?\\n\\nP4 18:22\\nYes, I did. It was strange because the first day I did not, but then the second day was like. It seemed like every prompt had one. It's just like, you know, like link you to Amazon and sometimes it was useful because, like, I think I like, like asked it about. I don't remember what the the prompt was like. Oh, like, where can I buy this near me? And it links me to an Amazon. And that was kind of useful, but otherwise it just seemed like every prompt had an ad that it didn't need.\\n\\nShristi 18:48\\nSo the sponsored ads that you were getting were not relevant to what you were asking at all?\\n\\nP4 19:01\\nI don't remember because like at a point I just kind of like ignored them because I just scrolled past. But like I remember thinking like, ohh, why is this? Why is there an ad for this like I was just asking a simple question, so I think there were times.\\n\\n\\nShristi 19:14\\nSo umm, so you know when you saw so many ads popping up, how did it make you feel at the time?\\n\\nP4 19:28\\nWhy I think at first I was surprised because I never knew that they had like sponsored ads in there. And then when it started, like becoming when it started to get to the point where, like every response and it was just, it just seemed like that one day it happened. I was like kind of frustrated, like, I'm like, why is there? Why is there an ad on every response here?\\n\\nShristi 19:47\\nSo during the interaction that we saw, we did find a few examples where you thought that the the response that you got were not accurate from MyAI. So having that pretext, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP4 20:15\\nI would say like Gene, generally like AI's or my eyes, like pretty good for like general stuff. I don't know if I would use it for something like statistics or like like more more recent information like I'd rather like Google that. But if it's like if it's like a like, it gave me a recipe for something like, I would trust that cause. It's just like a it's a recipe like I wouldn't ask anything like controversial, but if it's like a known thing that we've known for a long time, I would trust it there.\\n\\nShristi 20:43\\nSo when you say you would trust MyAI for non serious/personal stuff, So what kind of use cases do you think MyAI would help you in your daily life?\\n\\nP4 21:02\\nLike maybe stores near me. Like what those stores sell? Restaurants near me that are good, certain recipes that like stuff with food I think it would be good like earlier I was time of like if you maybe like if you're making a recipe and like you might not have a certain ingredient, I think MyAI  would be good to say ohh like what's a good substitute for this or like ohh I messed up this part of my recipe. Like how can I fix my cooking from here because that's like a more specific thing that like maybe Googling can't help with.\\n\\nShristi 21:33\\nDo you also feel comfortable using MyAI for something that's relevant to your academic tasks? Maybe learning something new or or even using it for something relevant in your assignments or maybe classes? Do you feel comfortable doing that?\\n\\nP4 21:53\\nI don't think it would be just cause like I don't know. I'd rather like either ask a professor or like, you know, find a different like more reliable source. I'm not sure because I don't know I wouldn't wanna like put that as like a source or, you know, I'd rather like do it independently, I feel like.\\n\\nShristi 22:10\\nSo when you were interacting it with stickers and pictures and even with your prompts, you might have shared something personal while interactive with MyAI. So what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by the company?\\n\\n\\nP4 22:35\\nI would say I'm actually like not super concerned because like I've never sent something over Snapchat that like I've been worried about getting out because I know like there's like a whole thing with like digital footprint. Like I I don't know like how they like translate the photo or like what they do with it, but like I just like make sure that I'm safe with it.\\nSo like if if what I put in is safe then like I know I'm not worried about it getting out.\\n\\nShristi 23:01\\nI think when we talked, I think we did not really talk much about the shopping task that we had, so do you remember how that shopping task went? If you remember, can you kind of walk us through what you did with it?\\n\\nP4 23:23\\nYeah, I think I just kind of like a niche like asked the broad question like hey, like what kind of stores are nearby me and like it told me at Walmart and Target and some other stories. And then from there I narrowed it down and said ohh like what does target sell? Like what does Walmart sell? Like can I buy this certain product at this store? Just like I started with like a broad term and then narrow it down, I would say the only issue with that was this was kind of like an off-side thing, but there's like a convenience store at Iowa State. And I asked it about that when they get it kind of got confused with like, a farmer's market at some point. But that was that was the only thing.\\n\\n\\nShristi 23:57\\nI do remember seeing that screenshot I think is that this little convenience store that's inside the. So is it the convenience store that's inside one of the apartments in in?\\n\\nP4 24:21\\nNo, I know you're talking about, but Union Drive Community Center.\\n\\nShristi 24:27\\nSo yeah, when you were talking with it about the convenience store, I think I think it give you like several recommendations of things you can find. I think by that time you realize that it was not talking about the convenience store and something else. And then you said, hey, it's not. I'm talking about this. So what products do you think can be found here? And I think the response MyAI gave was like pretty generic of what things you could find in any convenience store. It was like, hey, yeah, you can find sodas and snacks and stuff like that. So in in that interaction, how did you feel about the usefulness of the information in terms of the specific question that you had asked?\\n\\nP4 25:23\\nI would say I kind of realized that it wasn't super usefull for something that's specific like this certain small store. It's like not a good option for and I felt like I'd rather Google it or ask around at that point, whereas like something more broad like a big place like Walmart that you have like a lot of that's a good thing to ask MyAI for, but like a smaller store that might only have like one or a couple locations might not be as a that's good to ask about using MyAI.\\n\\nShristi 25:54\\nSo building a little bit upon the similarities and differences we talked about with ChatGPT, I think you've noticed that the way you talk with MyAI is a little bit different from what you would talk or or you know, like converse or communicate with ChatGPT. Because of the nature of what MyAI is represented as, does your interaction differ from what you would do with ChatGPT? Is there something different? How you pose the questions.\\n\\n\\nP4 26:38\\nI would think first I'll just like I would never like I was saying like use MyAI for academics. Since like I'm a MATH major, I might use ChatGPT if I'm confused on a concept I might use ChatGPT, like explain a some kind of concept to me in like a certain way that that way I could understand it better, whereas MyAI might be better for like we're saying like the cooking or travel recommendations. But I would like a prompt I would trust like ChadGPT more with like academic stuff, but I wouldn't rely on it fully of course.\\n\\n\\nShristi 27:15\\nSumming up, so summing up the entire interview. You've already talked about things that MyAI is good for, and I think you've already touched into it. But what cases do you think MyAI is not useful for at all?\\n\\n\\nP4 27:43\\nKind of like when I said it earlier, like anything super recent, anything that like people have a different opinion on like, controversial. I wanna use it for anything that's like like a statistic or fact. Or like ohh like can you like get a quote from this book for me? I'd rather like do that myself or like something academic. I don't think I would use MyAI for any of those things.\\n\\nShristi 28:06\\nSo yeah, that's all the questions that we had. Thank you so much for answering it. Yeah, we did it pretty fast. I was not expecting to be done with this early, but yeah, we had a good conversation. So before we end the recording, is there something that you would like to mention that we did not get around talking about?\\n\\nP4 28:30\\nUh, I guess it was interesting to see, like, I didn't realize, like the capability of MyAI before the study. So it kind of opened me up to like actually seeing like how you can utilize MyAI versus just kind of like messing around with it like I've realized it's actually pretty useful and have some good features.\\n\\n\\nKadir 28:56\\nUmm, so Jacob, I have a quick follow-up with one of your answers. You were saying that you would probably be feeling more reliable or you would think MyAI is not as reliable as ChatGPT for maybe serious tasks. I understand probably you are thinking about the responses you're getting from both systems and then maybe you are evaluating that reliability based on the responses. But other than the response quality, is there any other reasons why you think MyAI might seem less reliable than ChatGPT?\\n\\n\\nP4 29:46 \\nI don't even you know that's an interesting point. I can't really give any specifics on that because I've actually, I've never really tested it and like putting like a like a prompt like explain this concept to me before like that might be something to play around with because I wondered like I might just be thinking that cause like you know, I don't think of like Snapchat like the most professional thing. So it could just be like that kind of like setting like ohh, it's like snapchatting a like a friend, quote unquote when you're talking MyAI versus ChatGPR is more separated from that. So it could just be that. I think I might have to look into that more, but I wouldn't say that there's nothing really specific for my reasoning to be honest.\\n\\nKadir 30:26\\nOK. Thanks very much.\\n\", \"Transcript P3_Interview\\nMarch 21, 2024\\n\\nShristi started transcription\\n\\nKadir  0:12\\nOK, perfect.\\nSo let's start then.\\nThe recording has started.\\nCan you tell me a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP3   0:26\\nYeah.\\nSo my my full name is [P3].\\nI'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally.\\n\\nKadir  0:46\\nOK.\\nOK, senior in microbiology and genetics.\\n\\nP3   0:49\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir  0:50\\nOK and.\\nWhat social media platforms do you use?\\n\\nP3   0:58\\nOhm.\\nMore often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  1:06\\nIt's not OK.\\nAnd when did you start using Snapchat?\\n\\nP3   1:18\\nOoh, I wanna say.\\n8-8 years ago or maybe 9?\\n\\nKadir  1:27\\nEight or nine years ago.\\n\\nP3   1:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  1:28\\nOK.\\nOK, that's good to know.\\nUmm.\\nAnd then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general?\\n\\nP3   1:40\\nOhm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir  1:51\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   1:51\\nSo yeah, just chatting with friends.\\n\\nKadir  1:55\\nFriends.\\nOK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them.\\n\\nP3   1:59\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:01\\nOK.\\nOK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes.\\nGot it.\\n\\nP3   2:09\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  2:09\\nSo and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature?\\n\\nP3   2:21\\nUmm.\\nI wanna say, well, when did it do?\\nYou know when it began.\\n\\nKadir  2:29\\nI.\\n\\nShristi   2:30\\nI think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   2:32\\nA year ago.\\nOK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  2:38\\nUmm, when it first launched you either did it and then did.\\n\\nP3   2:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:43\\nDid you use?\\nSince then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time.\\n\\nP3   2:52\\nI used it when it first came out and then I didn't.\\nI guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again.\\n\\nKadir  3:01\\nOK.\\nThat's fair and OK, so.\\n\\nP3   3:03\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  3:08\\nJust uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago.\\nSo can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?\\nUmm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.\\nJust a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.\\n\\nP3   3:44\\nYeah, I like.\\nSo with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.\\nThings to see in a specific place.\\nSo if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.\\nWhat places can I see or what places can I eat?\\nAnd I like some of the suggestions that it gives.\\n\\nKadir  4:05\\nHmm.\\nSo mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions.\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   4:10\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  4:10\\nYeah.\\nSo make sense so.\\nDo you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those?\\nRecommendations for eating out or for a place to visit?\\n\\nP3   4:31\\nYeah.\\nSo when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.\\nSo then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.\\n\\nKadir  4:50\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   4:52\\nSo I liked that it kept that in mind.\\n\\nKadir  4:54\\nOK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?\\n\\nP3   5:08\\nUh.\\nOK, so if I were to put it on a scale of.\\n\\nKadir  5:15\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   5:16\\nI don't know one to five.\\nI guess I would say.\\n2 1/2.\\n\\nKadir  5:24\\nOK, in the middle. Mediocre.\\n\\nP3   5:25\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  5:28\\nOK.\\nIs there any?\\n\\nP3   5:32\\nReason.\\n\\nKadir  5:33\\nReason that led to this rating.\\n\\nP3   5:41\\nI just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.\\n\\nKadir  5:48\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   5:48\\nIf I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.\\n\\nKadir  6:10\\nHmm. Uh, OK, but.\\n\\nP3   6:16\\nSo I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.\\n\\nKadir  6:42\\nOh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?\\n\\nP3   6:59\\nUmm. Sorry, let me think.\\n\\nKadir  7:13\\nYes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.\\n\\nP3   7:24\\nUmm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.\\nI didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.\\n\\nKadir  7:45\\nUmm. Umm.\\n\\nP3   7:49\\nOtherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.\\n\\nShristi   8:14\\nIf it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff.\\n\\nP3   8:21\\nYeah, that helps.\\n\\nShristi   8:26\\nYeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like.\\n\\nP3   8:31\\nOK Ohh now I remember.\\nOK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.\\n\\nKadir  9:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   9:01\\nSo I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that.\\n\\nKadir  9:09\\nOK, OK. Yeah. Standing so. How much effort was required to use my AI chatbot? Uh. During your experiences?\\n\\nP3   9:27\\nUmm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about.\\nTo being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.\\nUmm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.\\n\\nKadir  10:05\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   10:07\\nBut yeah, I would say so.\\n\\nKadir  10:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   10:11\\nA little bit of effort, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  10:14\\nNot much, OK. OK. Umm do you think? If any special skills are needed to use my AI chatbot well.\\n\\nP3   10:35\\nUmm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  10:45\\nHmm.\\nIf I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]?\\nCan, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want.\\nSo and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require?\\n\\nP3   11:18\\nUmm, so could you repeat that question?\\n\\nKadir  11:23\\nI'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question.\\nYou said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want.\\nAnd was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?\\n\\nP3   11:48\\nOhh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it.\\n\\nKadir  12:05\\nUmm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI?\\n\\nP3   12:24\\nUmm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK.\\n\\nKadir  12:45\\nRight. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK.\\n\\nP3   12:55\\nYeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant.\\n\\nKadir  13:17\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   13:17\\nAnd I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine.\\nAnd then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad.\\nIt was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but.\\n\\nKadir  13:38\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   13:38\\nBut I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice.\\n\\nKadir  13:46\\nUmm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   13:59\\nOhh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out.\\nCould you repeat that?\\n\\nKadir  14:07\\nSure.\\nDo you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   14:21\\nOhm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:31\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   14:35\\nBut if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:44\\nOK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else?\\n\\nP3   15:04\\nOhm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture.\\nI don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  15:39\\nMm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that.\\n\\nP3   15:53\\nYeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.\\n \\nKadir  16:02\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   16:02\\nUmm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation.\\n\\nKadir  16:12\\nUmm.\\nHmm.\\nIt seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human.\\nUh. Features.\\n\\nP3   16:32\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  16:35\\nOK.\\nU], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII?\\n\\nP3   16:46\\nOhm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI.\\nSo then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you?\\n\\nKadir  17:02\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   17:08\\nI don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do.\\nAnd I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that.\\n\\nKadir  17:21\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   17:25\\nWhen it first came out.\\n\\nKadir  17:27\\nOK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms.\\n\\nP3   17:37\\nYeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it.\\n\\nKadir  17:57\\nOK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm.\\nOn on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study.\\n\\nP3   18:20\\nI feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically.\\n\\nKadir  18:53\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   18:55\\nI think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very.\\nHow do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more.\\n\\nKadir  19:29\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   19:38\\nSo it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.\\n\\nKadir  19:46\\nOK, OK.\\nUmm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:09\\nGonna say that hasn't really changed.\\n\\nKadir  20:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:13\\nHow are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could.\\n\\nKadir  20:19\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:28\\nIt could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  20:40\\nOK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:54\\nUmm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know.\\n\\nKadir  20:59\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   21:04\\nLike if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand.\\n\\nKadir  21:13\\nMm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity or difference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT.\\n\\nP3   21:43\\nI guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that.\\n\\nKadir  22:33\\nUmm. Hmm. OK.\\nUmm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with.\\nUmm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your?\\nPrompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them?\\n\\nP3   23:09\\nOh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah.\\n\\nKadir  23:12\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   23:15\\nI felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary.\\n\\nKadir  23:26\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   23:31\\nUmm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time.\\n\\nKadir  23:41\\nSo it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a.\\n\\nP3   23:46\\nUmhm.\\n\\nKadir  23:47\\nSo you can't make it on and off.\\n\\nP3   23:51\\nOh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off?\\n\\nKadir  23:55\\nI don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either.\\n\\nP3   23:57\\nOhh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links.\\nI might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would.\\n\\nKadir  24:07\\nWhat?\\n\\nP3   24:07\\nIt would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:28\\nOK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it?\\nCan I quickly ask?\\n\\nP3   24:41\\nOh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:44\\nYeah.\\nOr you said you were watching it, right?\\n\\nP3   24:47\\nOh, oh, no, no.\\nI was just, uh, I just said Ohh.\\nI think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip and then that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after.\\n\\nKadir  24:54\\nYeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements.\\nAlso, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very?\\nGeneric.\\n\\nP3   25:27\\nI think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about.\\n\\nKadir  25:33\\nUmm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses?\\n\\nP3   25:49\\nWell, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses.\\n\\nKadir  26:02\\nDid you? Yeah.\\n\\nP3   26:02\\nSo I I feel like it's probably 50-50.\\n\\nKadir  26:06\\nHmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers.\\n\\nP3   26:26\\nUmm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists.\\n\\nKadir  26:39\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   26:43\\nBut yeah, that that's all I really had the chance to look at.\\n\\nKadir  26:48\\nAnd then what was your shopping experience by the way, can you remind that to us? Shopping task.\\n\\nP3   26:55\\nYeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for.\\n\\nKadir  27:08\\nRight.\\n\\nP3   27:09\\nI don't know places that I had really good deals.\\n\\nKadir  27:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   27:15\\nAnd it was giving me.\\n\\nKadir  27:15\\nOr yeah, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:17\\nOhh sorry what?\\n\\nKadir  27:19\\nStores,. You mean?\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   27:20\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:20\\nI just remember, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:22\\nYeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person.\\n\\nKadir  27:35\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   27:35\\nOne of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:43\\nOK.\\nOK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform?\\n\\nP3   28:15\\nUmm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached.\\nI don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it.\\n\\nKadir  28:41\\nHmm.\\nOK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense.\\nUmm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly?\\n\\nP3   29:05\\nOhm.\\nI guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries.\\nEven if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.\\n\\nKadir  29:57\\nOK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more.\\n\\nP3   29:59\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  30:02\\nOK.\\nYeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again.\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for attending us.\\nI don't know if should see as a question or not, but.\\n\\nShristi   30:15\\nUmm I I have a few more questions.\\nI'll just go ahead and ask your.\\nSo do you see just to reel back a little bit?\\n\\nP3   30:20\\nOK.\\n\\nShristi   30:25\\nSo I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries.\\n\\nP3   30:47\\nOhh yeah.\\n\\nShristi   30:51\\nAnd then? You asked it.\\nHey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right?\\nAnd then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it.\\nAnd then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think.\\nAnd it said, hey, what else is going on?\\nAre there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshots after that?\\nSo did you, like, continue the conversation after that?\\nDo you remember anything from that day regarding it?\\n\\nP3   31:24\\nOhh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that?\\n\\nShristi   31:42\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   31:43\\nSo I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like.\\n\\nShristi   31:44\\nOK.\\nHmm.\\nOK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new?\\nConversation starters.\\nUh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it.\\nSo how do you feel about that interaction in general?\\n\\nP3   32:15\\nUh.\\nI feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm.\\nAnd when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person.\\n\\nShristi   32:51\\nUmm OK.\\n\\nP3   32:52\\nSo it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer.\\n\\nShristi   32:57\\nUmm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or five different things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for.\\n\\nP3   33:36\\nI want to say it's good for.\\nI mean, I keep bringing this up, but.\\nSince I like food, I like exploring new food places.\\nI like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even?\\nUmm definitely.\\nWhen I've tried to talk to ChatGPT.\\nYeah, it's just kind of curves me.\\nIt's like, OK, ask me the question now.\\nAnd even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue.\\nHaving a conversation with you as long as you wanted to.\\nUmm. What?\\nIt's bad for though.\\nI'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate.\\nIf that mean it's even less accurate, there we go.\\nIn a lot of a lot of things.\\nSo I think that's what it's bad that.\\n\\nShristi   34:46\\nMm-hmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOhm.\\nSo I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left.\\nI guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK.\\nSo final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly?\\n\\nP3   35:41\\nI wish there was.\\nI don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.\\nI don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for.\\nIt's just.\\nI just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but.\\nBecause I I still didn't even know what it was for.\\nReally, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for.\\nMaybe.\\nBut even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for.\\nIf it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources.\\n\\nShristi   36:29\\nHmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOK, I think that's all I had.\\nSo thank you so much.\\nI'll.\\nI'll pass it back to Kadir.\\nWhere you left it off.\\n\\nKadir  36:45\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for.\\nYeah.\\nHating in our diary study.\\nAnd so at the same time, and enjoy.\\nUh, Daisy.\\nUh, let's just kind of like is our session very much.\\nWould you like to right now?\\n\\nP3   37:11\\nOh wait, sorry.\\nDid you say something like?\\nAre you asking me a question?\\n\\nKadir  37:14\\nI'm just saying, are we?\\nAre we able to right now end the conversation the interview?\\n\\nP3   37:20\\nOh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nVery good.\\n\\nKadir  37:29\\nBye, bye.\\n\\nP3   37:30\\nGoodbye.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P1_Interview\\nMarch 11, 2024, 7:05PM\\n\\nShristi  0:07\\nOk.\\nOK, so we have started the recording and transcription.\\nI just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions.\\nSo can you tell us a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP1  0:21\\nSure. Umm.\\nSo my name is [--].\\nI'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program.\\nThis is my second to last semester.\\nUmm before that I'm.\\nI'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years.\\nDecided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer.\\n\\nShristi   1:02\\nUmm, thank you.\\nSo which social media platforms are using currently?\\n\\nP1  1:10\\nUmm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok.\\n\\nShristi 1:22\\nAnd Tiktok.\\nOK umm so.\\nUmm.\\nSo when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so?\\n\\nP1  1:31\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi  1:38\\nDo you remember when you started using Snapchat?\\n\\nP1   1:41\\nYeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I first started using it.\\nAnd I was definitely a lot more active on it early on.\\nI'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much.\\nAnd my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories.\\n\\nShristi   2:15\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1  2:20\\nSo because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much.\\nAnd my friends aren't.\\nI don't go it on it too much anymore.\\nI literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing.\\n\\nShristi   2:36\\nUmm.\\nOK.\\nSo yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera?\\n\\nP1   2:51\\nYeah.\\nSo I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notifications from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories.\\n\\nShristi   3:16\\nOK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family?\\n\\nP1   3:23\\nI do.\\nIt's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while.\\n\\nShristi   3:30\\nYeah, and.\\n\\nP1   3:34\\nAnd like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot.\\nSo I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends.\\nLike if I think of them every once in a while.\\n\\nShristi   3:54\\nHmm.\\nOK, makes sense.\\nSo how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study?\\n\\nP1   4:03\\nUmm, I actually have not used it.\\nI..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my first thought was like I really had no interest in trying it.\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   4:20\\nYeah. OK.\\n\\nP1   4:21\\nIt just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it.\\nLike back when it was first released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out.\\n\\nShristi   4:53\\nYeah, yeah, of course.\\nOhm.\\nSo I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now.\\n\\nP1   5:06\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   5:06\\nUmm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI?\\nSo you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went.\\n\\nP1   5:23\\nSure.\\n\\nShristi   5:27\\nIf you remember it.\\n\\nP1   5:29\\nYeah.\\nSo did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?\\n\\nShristi   5:35\\nYeah, of course.\\n\\nP1   5:37\\nOK, sure.\\nSo the one I remember the most was my first time using it.\\nUmm.\\nAnd it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US.\\n\\nShristi   5:56\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:00\\nAnd so for that one.\\nI wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me.\\n\\nShristi   6:07\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:08\\nLike decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good.\\n\\nShristi   6:16\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   6:16\\nSo umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar.\\nSo like I think the first thing I said was like, hi, how are you?\\n\\nShristi   6:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   6:32\\nLike how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model.\\n\\nShristi   6:41\\nNo.\\n\\nP1   6:42\\nSo it was interesting that I like felt like doing that.\\nAnd then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.\\nAnd I've noticed that my like conversation.\\nNo, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back.\\n\\nWell, at first I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts.\\n\\nP1   8:15\\nUmm.\\nSo yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions.\\n\\nShristi   8:34\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   8:35\\nAnd it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the final recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night.\\nSo I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary.\\nI actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by.\\n\\nUmm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days.\\n\\nShristi   9:30\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   9:45\\nAnd I'm like, I don't know about that.\\n\\nShristi   9:48\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   9:48\\nAnd also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources.\\nUmm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in.\\n\\nShristi   10:46\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   10:46\\nAnd so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore.\\n\\nShristi   10:55\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   10:58\\nLike the same like trip when I actually was, but I like.\\n\\nShristi   10:59\\nUmm, you know?\\n\\nP1   11:02\\nI thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip.\\nUmm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was fine.\\n\\nShristi   11:14\\nOhh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else.\\n\\nP1   11:27\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   11:28\\nSo yeah, so much for sharing that.\\nSo I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?\\n\\nP1   11:37\\nMm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better.\\n\\nShristi   12:24\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   12:24\\nLike I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me?\\nAnd because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary.\\n\\nShristi   12:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   12:43\\nA recommendation was definitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker.\\n\\nShristi   13:01\\nUmm.\\nUmm, OK, thank you.\\nSo..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back?\\n\\nP1   13:34\\nUmm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation.\\nI like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time.\\n\\nShristi   13:55\\nHmm hmm.\\n\\nP1   14:06\\nUmm.\\nLike if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option.\\nUmm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should have like asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews.\\n\\nShristi   14:52\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   14:56\\nLike from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products.\\n\\nShristi   15:10\\nYep.\\n\\nP1   15:11\\nIt did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that.\\n\\nShristi   15:30\\nUmm. Given of course.\\nOK, makes sense.\\nSo moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot?\\n\\nP1   15:46\\nUmm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time.\\n\\nShristi   16:30\\nUmm OK.\\n\\nP1   16:33\\nSo pretty effortless.\\n\\nShristi   16:36\\nOK.\\nSo do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well?\\n\\nP1   16:47\\nUmm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.\\n\\nShristi   17:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   17:01\\nYou would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations.\\nLike if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed.\\nAnd if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human.\\n\\nShristi   17:42\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   17:44\\nSo yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it.\\n\\nShristi   17:52\\nOK, so did you encounter any specific obstacles when you were using the tool?\\n\\nP1   18:05\\nAnd so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones.\\n\\nShristi   18:29\\nHmm.\\nSo when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers?\\n\\nP1   18:43\\nUmm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh.\\n\\nShristi   18:49\\nOK.\\n\\nP1   18:52\\nOK.\\nCan you guys hear me alright?\\n\\nShristi   18:54\\nYeah, we do.\\n\\nP1   18:56\\nUh, yeah.\\nSo whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like.\\nCan you give me links with pictures?\\nSo I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing.\\nBut in other times.\\nI think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like specific models of backpacks within this brand and like specific colors.\\nIt then gave me specific models but not specific colors.\\n\\nShristi   20:00\\nUmm. OK. Makes sense.\\nSo when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the specific feature properly.\\n\\nP1   20:27\\nActually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it.\\n\\nShristi   20:50\\nOK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.\\nSo I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it.\\n\\nP1   21:12\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   21:14\\nSo can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard?\\n\\nP1   21:18\\nYeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it.\\n\\nShristi   21:48\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   21:48\\nUh, or like banter with it?\\nAnd a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.\\nSo like. I don't remember. I..I remember one specifically, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out.\\n\\nShristi   22:32\\nOh really?\\n\\nP1   22:33\\nYeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm.\\n\\nShristi   22:43\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   22:46\\nUmm.\\nAnd yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it.\\nThat's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer.\\nLike I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers.\\n\\nShristi   23:07\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   23:11\\nLike I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing.\\n\\nShristi   23:21\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   23:23\\nSo yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people.\\n\\nShristi   23:28\\nOK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it?\\n\\nP1   23:43\\nUmm, I would say no.\\nBecause all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny.\\nBut it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing.\\n\\nShristi   24:10\\nMakes sense.\\nOhm so.\\nSo if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone?\\n\\nP1   24:26\\nUmm.\\nI'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh.\\nWhat am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it.\\n\\nShristi   25:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   25:36\\nSo like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever.\\n\\nShristi   25:36\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   25:41\\nAnything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all.\\n\\nShristi   25:45\\nYeah, makes sense.\\n\\nP1   25:49\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   25:50\\nSo have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI?\\n\\nP1   26:04\\nNo, I I don't think so.\\n\\nShristi   26:07\\nHmm, OK.\\nSo have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI?\\n\\nP1   26:21\\nI think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.\\n\\nShristi   26:27\\nUmm so so.\\n\\nP1   26:28\\nWhich is just, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   26:30\\nHmm.\\nSo, so so when so when you are using chat GPT.\\nSo do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines?\\n\\nP1   26:49\\nUmm.\\nI have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example.\\n\\nShristi   27:20\\nMm-hmm.\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   27:29\\nLike I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others.\\n\\nShristi   28:21\\nUmm.\\nUmm yeah, sure.\\nSo do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have?\\n\\nP1   28:40\\nI'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm.\\nI think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure.\\nUh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need.\\nAnd I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not specifically asking like the Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like.\\n\\nShristi   29:51\\nUmm.\\nOK. Makes sense.\\nUmm.\\nSo if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things?\\n\\nP1   30:08\\nUmm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this.\\n\\nShristi   30:22\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   30:31\\nLike Ohh knowing like machine somewhere.\\n\\nShristi   30:35\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   30:36\\nWhere it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different.\\n\\nShristi   31:06\\nYeah, I think that's that's fair.\\nSo when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads?\\n\\nP1   31:19\\nUmm.\\nOhh no, I don't think so.\\n\\nShristi   31:28\\nOhh OK really OK.\\n\\nP1   31:30\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   31:32\\nUmm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding back and giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least.\\n\\nP1   31:48\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   31:49\\nAnd you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat?\\n\\nP1   32:02\\nYeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin.\\n\\nShristi   32:10\\nOK.\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   32:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   32:11\\nSo maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed.\\n\\nP1   32:15\\nIt just knows, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   32:17\\nYeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then.\\nOK, so so when you receive any recommendations.\\nSo for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that?\\n\\nP1   32:42\\nUmm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way.\\n\\nShristi   33:06\\nOK, makes sense.\\n\\nP1   33:08\\nUh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.\\n\\nShristi   33:29\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   33:33\\nIt almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not.\\n\\nShristi   33:45\\nUmm.\\nUmm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you finish the conversation.\\n\\nP1   33:53\\nI think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that.\\n\\nShristi   34:11\\nHmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry.\\n\\nP1   34:42\\nUh, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   34:42\\nOhh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reflect back on that experience a little bit for us?\\n\\nP1   34:53\\nYeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to fly?\\n\\nShristi   35:15\\nThis is.\\n\\nP1   35:20\\nAnd I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke.\\n\\nShristi   35:27\\nUmm. Yeah.\\n\\nP1   35:32\\nAnd then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it.\\nLike this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes?\\nAnd then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it.\\n\\nShristi   36:11\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nYeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously.\\n\\nP1   36:22\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   36:24\\nYeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you filters.\\n\\nP1   36:34\\nOhh yeah.\\n\\nShristi   36:34\\nOhm, I'm so.\\nSo can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us?\\n\\nP1   36:42\\nYeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like.\\n\\nP1   36:56\\nAsk it to recommend a filter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and first of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway.\\n\\nShristi   37:00\\nUmm.\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   37:11\\nSo I don't know what that was about.\\n\\nShristi   37:15\\nOK.\\n\\nP1   37:16\\nBut yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a filter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat filter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the filter homepage.\\n\\nShristi   37:45\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   37:47\\nOf the camera like tab.\\n\\nShristi   37:49\\nThe where we where we take, where we take new snaps.\\n\\nP1   37:53\\nYeah.\\nLike when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the filters.\\n\\nShristi   38:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   38:00\\nIt was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that specific cat filter.\\n\\nShristi   38:04\\nThat OK. Umm, so.\\nSo when you were not able to reach the specific filter, how how did it make you feel at the time?\\n\\nP1   38:19\\nYou know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this filter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   38:45\\nYeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right.\\n\\nP1   38:49\\nYeah. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nShristi   38:51\\nOK. Yeah, makes sense.\\nOK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.\\nSo I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more specific I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP1   39:17\\nYeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual?\\n\\nShristi   39:24\\nYeah.\\nIn terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes?\\n\\nP1   39:45\\nYeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times.\\nSo maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to.\\n\\nShristi   40:11\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   40:31\\nBut I wouldn't take it at face value.\\n\\nShristi   40:38\\nYeah, right.\\n\\nP1   40:40\\nAnd like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other?\\n\\nShristi   41:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   41:01\\nUh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account?\\nDoes it know how expensive it is?\\n\\nShristi   41:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   41:11\\nDoes it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?\\n\\nShristi   41:15\\nYeah.\\n\\nP1   41:16\\nIt's like for like minute details.\\nI I would do that research on my own.\\n\\nShristi   41:23\\nHmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with.\\n\\nP1   41:34\\nBasically, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   41:35\\nYeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those?\\n\\nP1   42:11\\nYeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself?\\n\\nShristi   42:37\\nI mean.\\n\\nP1   42:41\\nSo I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself.\\n\\nShristi   42:52\\nUmm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reflecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for?\\n\\nP1   43:16\\nUmm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively.\\nUm and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to figure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality or something to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future.\\n\\nShristi   44:02\\nOK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and.\\n\\nKadir   44:05\\nI have a quick question.\\nI have a quick question.\\n\\nP1   44:09\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   44:09\\nJust before finishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate.\\n\\nP1   44:24\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   44:27\\nI mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to figure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that?\\n\\nP1   44:54\\nYeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference.\\n\\nKadir   45:13\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   45:13\\nProbably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human.\\nAnd. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even.\\n\\nKadir   45:29\\nHmm.\\n\\nP1   45:32\\nUmm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the Snapchat AI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT.\\n\\nKadir   46:06\\nUmm.\\n\\nShristi   46:12\\nNo. Yeah.\\n\\nKadir   46:14\\nHmm.\\nHmm, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   46:17\\nMe, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for specifically for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for?\\n\\nP1   46:37\\nUmm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned?\\n\\nShristi   47:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:01\\nI'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games.\\nLike maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it.\\n\\nShristi   47:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:11\\nUmm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games.\\nRight. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or.\\n\\nShristi   47:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:30\\nIf it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.\\n\\nShristi   47:49\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   47:59\\nSo somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case.\\n\\nKadir   48:07\\nUmm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here.\\n\\nShristi   48:14\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   48:17\\nThat's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that?\\n\\nP1   48:47\\nUh, could you say that again? So like uh?\\n\\nKadir   48:51\\nSure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings.\\n\\nP1   49:09\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir   49:26\\nAs far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong.\\n\\nP1   49:27\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir   49:29\\nAnd how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI?\\n\\nP1   49:49\\nYeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine.\\n\\nKadir   50:07\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP1   50:08\\nThat's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations.\\n\\nKadir   50:13\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:15\\nAnd I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more.\\n\\nKadir   50:29\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:40\\nOr, uh, like like human?\\nLike so.\\n\\nKadir   50:46\\nUmm.\\n\\nP1   50:46\\nLike if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know.\\nLike why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers.\\n\\nKadir   50:54\\nUmm. Yeah. Thanks very much.\\n\\nP1   51:07\\nYeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted.\\n\\nKadir   51:13\\nOhh wait, you're you're muted.\\n\\nShristi   51:16\\nI do it all the time.\\nI'm sorry.\\n\\nP1   51:18\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nShristi   51:19\\nSo yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention?\\n\\nP1   51:30\\nNo, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun.\\nThanks for inviting me to participate.\\n\\nShristi   51:36\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nKadir   51:37\\nDefinitely.\\n\\nShristi   51:37\\nYeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\"]\n",

      "[\"Transcript P2_Interview March 18, 2024, 12:10AM Shristi started transcription Kadir 0:15 OK, perfect. So. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, if possible? P2 0:25 Little about myself? Kadir 0:27 Yes, yes. P2 0:27 OK, so I'm a graduate student here, here at the [a US university], and now graduating this year. So I'm doing my civil engineering masters in civil engineering with an emphasis on Geotechnical engineering. I think I have been using Snapchat for the past three years. If you want to know. Kadir 0:50 Wow. Past three years, it's been quite a few kind of like experience probably it seems alright So then could you also tell me what social media platforms do you use other than, let's say, in this case, Snapchat? P2 1:10 Uh, so Instagram. Facebook, mostly on Instagram and mostly Instagram. Other than that, Facebook, sometimes with Twitter, and that's all. If LinkedIn counts as social media, I did that while I was searching for jobs, but not anymore. Kadir 1:28 So we get an Instagram. Facebook OK. Yeah, that's that's fair. So. When when did you start using Snapchat? Uh. P2 1:46 So yeah, it was like back and forth when I when I was back in [a South Asian Country]. So I usually use for like one month and then the not use that for like one year and then again come back. But after I came to US like it's been like 2 years, most probably. So I've been like continuously using it for the past two years.I would say. Kadir 2:05No. OK. So just. Is there any umm what makes a continuous use in the US for Snapchat? Is there any kind of like reason for? P2 2:18 And now, and there's not, not not this kind of disparity while competing with [a South Asian Country] and US, but just that when I am in the US, I could like connect with my friends, move through Snapchat with home in [a South Asian Country] So back back when I was in [a South Asian Country], I didn't didn't need to do that because I was actually there. So that makes it easy to like… Kadir 2:36 OK, OK. Yeah. P2 2:37 ..know what they're doing like in their daily life. And like you know about their situations, where it's pretty fun. Kadir 2:43 Yeah, I got it. That makes sense. That makes sense. I relate to that for sure. P2 2:49 Yeah. Kadir 2:50 What do you do most on on the on the Snapchat then could you tell us a little bit? P2 2:56 Yeah. So. So I'm like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you're doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it's like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it's kind of like to. So what you're doing on a bit daily basis, so it's kind of fun. Kadir 3:28 OK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well. P2 3:32 Yeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah. Kadir 3:45 OK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?P2 4:02 Uh, so when it was ﬁrst released, I don't know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don't know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was ﬁrst released, but to be honest, after that I haven't really used this before this program or before your project. Kadir 4:10 Umm. P2 4:22 So yeah, I don't have very much experience than you guys as well, so. Kadir 4:22 Umm. Yeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was. P2 4:32 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here. Kadir 4:35 Yeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it? P2 4:39 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat ﬁeld whenever you Instagram. Kadir 4:44 Umm. P2 4:45 So it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven't really used it. Kadir 4:53 OK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature. P2 5:07 Yeah. Yeah, I did. Kadir 5:08 Uh, yeah. P2 5:08 I did.Kadir 5:09 So then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn't related to the study. P2 5:21 Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you ﬁrst was. What was the ﬁrst task? If you can remind me. Kadir 5:34 I think we asked you to have a travel recommendation. P2 5:39 Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn't think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days. I have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the ﬁrst answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary. Kadir 5:58 Umm. P2 6:03 It give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing. So I..I was kind of like I didn't check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing. Kadir 6:20 Ohh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details. P2 6:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kadir 6:27 OK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that ﬁrst task? P2 6:40 No, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So ﬁrst of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat. Kadir 6:59OK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences. P2 7:16 My prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the “guess the country's ﬂag” game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that's all I have. Kadir 7:34 Umm. P2 7:36 It's like kind of. It's not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it's it's kind of cool. Kadir 7:47 Yeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don't know, like kill time at the time and then. P2 7:53 You're saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it. Kadir 8:08 Mm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience? P2 8:31 OK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I'm working on my thesis or something like that. So it's really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that's why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I've used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two. Kadir 9:01 Hmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations? P2 9:17 With my expectations, OK, so. Kadir 9:20 Mm-hmm.P2 9:24 Umm. Let's see. I'm gonna. I'm going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker. Kadir 9:37 Yes. P2 9:39 It didn't perform that well on this one. So I think the ﬁrst the ﬁrst tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me ﬁrst suggestion on soccer cleats but didn't like it, didn't like provide like such great information on that. And also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn't recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period. It's going like provide much information about there. So I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one. Kadir 10:41 The ﬁrst one. P2 10:42 Yeah. The ﬁrst one was the. Yeah, it was the best one. Kadir 10:46 The the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it. P2 10:52 Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Kadir 10:54 Yeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember. P2 11:03 I..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains. Kadir 11:10 Rocky mountains.P2 11:11 Yeah. Kadir 11:14 So do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean? P2 11:20 That's where I would go. Yeah, absolutely. I gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life. Kadir 11:23 OK. P2 11:29 So and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that’s a place where I would deﬁnitely go in the future, so. Kadir 11:36 Maybe that's why you it could be aligning. OK, OK. P2 11:40 Yeah. Kadir 11:40 I totally understand. Yeah. So then also, yeah. Can you share an experience where it didn't meet your expectations? And then yeah, that would be nice. P2 11:50 No. OK, OK. So let me go over the task with the shopping list, right? The..where you wanted to do like buy something. Kadir 11:59 Yes. P2 12:05 I really needed a new.. Kadir 12:06 You wanted to buy, right? P2 12:08 Yeah, I I needed a new soccer cleats right now, so I just try to like incorporate that in the task as well. So I asked him to like, suggest me some soccer cleats based on my position of play like soccer ﬁeld. So I play midﬁelders generally, so I wanted something light and something that lasted me long because last soccer cleat that I bought was like only for three or four months.It suggested me like 2..2 of the like most famous soccer cleats, which were like all over the Internet as so. Yeah. And I asked like, it is a well out of my budget. So can you like say say something in between like 150 to $200.00 but it still gave me the same same two models that it showed me like previously and after that what I did was I asked for like the pictures. Like the pictures, if if you provide like pictures from the Internet but no it it couldn't provide that So I think that was the worst experience with me. So it's sort of like a prompt insert a picture of [inaudible] within like big brackets. You can see in the screenshots so it was kind of like not that good. Kadir 13:14 Yeah. What was lacking in in that? P2 13:17 Yeah. So I I I asked the picture of like 2 soccer cleats that it was trying to show me earlier and it couldn't like provide me the picture and also the it couldn't like uh what do you say..suggest the price..uh..the cleats within my budget so. It it only knew about like 2 soccer cleats and it kind of like repeatedly went on and went on about the same thing again and again even if you asked like different questions. Kadir 13:46 Umm, so it was not.. OK. Yeah, I I I got it. Deﬁnitely. So, uh, how much effort was required to use MyAI chatbot in your experiences so far? P2 14:05 I guess it depends on like what kind of question you’re asking. So again, so the ﬁrst task that I did was like pretty smooth and I got what was required within like 3 or 4 questions or prompts. But for the..as I have said like.. Kadir 14:17 Mm-hmm. P2 14:21 The soccer cleats one.. the shopping list and also the describe the picture or something like that. So it took like will more than like ten tries to get even get like close to it. So it was like stuck on one thing and it's going to go like up from that. So even if I ask a lot of questions, so yeah, I think it depends on my experience. It depends on what you're actually trying to ask out of the MyAI feature. Kadir 14:46 OK. So then as far as I understand, do you mean, I mean it depends on the topic. It depends on. P2 14:53 Yeah, yeah. It depends on the topic and how well known the topic is. I most probably because National parks are like more searched than football cleats..I guess..all over the Internet and yeah, I did ask it about like this dish from [a South Asian Country] during my photo.. Task with the photo uploading a picture and then asking about the picture.So it couldn't recognize that, and even if I like told it that it was like a dish from [a South Asian Country]. So it could not provide much information about that as well. So I think it depends on how what would people like asking the in the Internet more. So if you like talk about a least talked topic with the MyAI think it just like other time to like actually go into the topic you like you'll be stuck somewhere around like in the ﬁrst two or three replies and then if you like try to get more out of it..it will take some time on those kind of topics. Kadir 15:28 OK. Umm. I I get it. Yeah. When it start then it's it's not maybe forwarding with the conversation, unfortunately. P2 16:01 Yeah. Kadir 16:02 OK. So, uh, uh, do you think any skills are needed? Uh, any any skills are needed to use MyAI chatbot well or effectively let's say. P2 16:19 I think even like no basic English writing and reading then it would be enough. You doing anything so that you just need to know about the Snapchat interface interface and just the basic English that you do writing, typing, reading. So I think that that that's enough.So I don't think that's like too much. Kadir 16:37 Umm, so basically kind of English proﬁciency and then kind of writing, typing and you said writing typing. P2 16:43 Yeah. Kadir 16:45 I mean, do you think? By writing, is there any? Speciﬁc skills for. P2 16:55 And not have I just writing because like the way the AI AI reacts to your message like it largely or it mostly depends on your prompt right. If you like, try to get trying to get some information out of the MyAI but you are not like expressing yourself well in the prompt. So then it will like take wrong turn on like it will not understand what you'd like to say. So if you have like good understanding of English writing and reading and then a good understanding of Snapchat because you have to ﬁrst of all go to MyAI to like type type it out. So if you have a good knowledge of that interface, then I think anyone can do this.Kadir 17:28 Umm. P2 17:32 Anyone, anyone can utilize this yeah. Kadir 17:33 OK. OK. So just here I have one more follow up. So then do you think in terms of writing or typing? Different writing and prompting would would would differ. Do you think I mean how is your experience with that? P2 17:59 I think so. Yeah, I think like the way you write or like the way you present a prompt to an to MyAI. So it will deﬁnitely like the answer would be deﬁnitely different, so I don't know how to ﬁx it, but yeah, if you like, try a write a prompt in it like a detailed manner. Kadir 18:09 Umm. P2 18:15 So you should like express all the things that you need to get out of my head. Sometimes it might work, but sometimes it can't, like necessarily pushes all the information. I think like that. So that's why I always like start with the small short short, short prompt and then try to go into deep into the conversation after it kind of like replies in a good way or replies in a good direction. Kadir 18:32 Yeah. P2 18:37 So if yeah. Kadir 18:39 OK. Umm. And in your experiences during the diary study or prior, did you encounter any obstacles when using MyAI. P2 18:56 Obstacles. And does advertisements count as obstacle? Because I received like a lot of that. Kadir 19:03 Hmm so. P2 19:05Yeah, they were like a lot of extra, but it's advertisements which are not related to my prompts or anything like that. So this has been like annoying. Other than that, I don't think so. I like a little bit of trouble uploading a picture. I don't know why it like took a lot of long time. It took like about one minute to upload a picture, so I think those two are the major things that I did not like or would say obstacles while doing your the diary stories. Kadir 19:27 Mm-hmm. So what makes advertisements? Kind of like annoying for you. Or think you are that they are, they might be obstacle. P2 19:44 So if if the advertisement are like what I'm looking for. So if I'm like if they are like what, how do I put it? So if I see a random advertisement on my screen, so it must be like something related to what I'm trying to say, right to MyAI. Kadir 19:58 Hearing me. P2 19:59 But it is like some random kind of thing, like some magazine covers or something like that. So which I haven't really talked about it with MyAI then I think that it's like kind of annoying. Kadir 20:11 OK, OK. Yeah, yeah, deﬁnitely. If if it's not related to your purpose, I understand. P2 20:16 Yeah. Kadir 20:16 Yep. Uh. So. Do you like? Do you feel like you have access to necessary resources to use MyAI properly? P2 20:29 Yeah, I think so. Kadir 20:31 OK. So that's that's fair enough. And have you heard somebody in your circle or environment else talk about MyAI before? P2 20:49 When, it like ﬁrst came out. Yes, but after that I don't think like anybody is using it would even though people using Snapchat. So when it ﬁrst came out, like we were like, kind of, what do you say we were like, trying to see what that was? So it was introduced as your personal assistant on Snapchat ﬁrst. So before MyAI, I think so it it was introduced as personal assistant. So I had like few talks with it and also some of my friends did as well. So yeah, but I don't think it's like that, that that used right now.Kadir 21:18 And. OK so. P2 21:22 I can't speak for all of all of us, but that's what I think. Kadir 21:27 OK, so it can be a friend. It can be an acquaintance or a media, so probably you've heard from friends when it came up ﬁrst. As far as I understand. P2 21:36 Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be your friend as well. So as I told you earlier, so when I was stuck once in the airport so I had nothing to do with having to talk with an AI. So yeah, it it did help me at that time. So it can be your friend. Kadir 21:48 OK. OK. P2 21:49 You're gonna situation, yeah. Kadir 21:51 Yeah. So then yeah, it's more like if you if you, I mean you said for example you might be considering it as a friend or maybe personal assistant. So does this affect anything or how does it, you know affect you communication with with MyAI. P2 22:17 So if you're like trying to like, uh, if you think of it as a friend, I think, and your prompt are what you type into the my hair would be like a lot of a lot friendly. So I think that's the only thing. So what? What you consider it as if you like. Think of it like a search engine. Or like, uh, yeah, feature that will help you to get some information. So you are prompt would would would be formal and you would like have to like type it in a detail. But if you like using it for fun so it can be like short and like silly kind of prompts because you that depends on the intent of use right? Kadir 22:51 Umm. P2 22:53 So I think there's there's the rest of the difference. Kadir 22:57 OK. Yeah, so. Have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAI? P2 23:11No, not exactly MyAI, but like another a lot of other generative AI, so even my professor my advisor tells me to like properly use like ChatGPT or something like that. Other generative AI, but not exactly my Snapchat. Yeah, because I think the demographics are the people using my AI is like kind of like limited to teenagers right now. So they are not the guys who I would take advice with. Kadir 23:32 Uh-huh. P2 23:35 So I think that that. Kadir 23:37 Well, OK, OK, I got it. P2 23:38 We could. Kadir 23:41 So would you recommend trying myAI to your friends? P2 23:49 Yes, you're I can do that. Kadir 23:54 And why? P2 23:55 But but according to the user's there, according to the uses, if they want to like search for anything speciﬁc then I wouldn't like tell them to go to go and search in MyAI because I don't think like it's like that effective. Kadir 23:55 Why would you? Why would you? P2 24:09 But if they just want to have fun, I can like this. Suggest them this. Speak with MyAI in the future. It was one like I can say like that, but if they want like get some information out of MyAI, then I would not recommend it. Kadir 24:22 OK, OK. And since starting using my I have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?P2 24:34 No, no, I I have noticed with I think it is just the same. Kadir 24:35 General social media habits, I mean. OK. Uh, do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to MyAI? P2 24:52 My uh, yeah, I use like ChatGPT on a daily basis. Kadir 24:57 Umm. P2 24:57 All the other than that, I don't think I have like much explicit experience with other generative AI apps or some like that. I think that ChatGPT is the only one. Kadir 25:07 OK. Yeah. I asked this but still I wanna ask. Maybe a kind of follow up. What is similar between chat GPT and MyAI or? And what is different in essence? P2 25:25 OK. So in essence, OK, so the I think what I feel is like ChatGPT, if you like ask any questions. So it will like generally it will respond in like formal matters like and I use it like more more for like formal things. So if I have to write to mail and I want to like make like make it like good I ask such as visual change the mail and change the mail to a better format. And if I'm writing a document and I think that my English is a little bit bad, then I asked the charge to change it into kind of like formal or like more scientiﬁc terms or write in a better way or for clarity or something like that. So I think it's like more more used in like ofﬁce kind of work with ChatGPT. Uh, for me personally, so actually use this during my thesis.. so during my thesis. I use this use this a lot but MyAI I think it's just like as I said earlier. So I we can use it as a friend. So if I you don't need to be like that formal it doesn't. It doesn't become that formal with you in the responses, so it's like kind of like friendly chat I felt. So yeah, I think the main difference between that is like my uses, it depends on my users as well. Kadir 26:33 Hmm. P2 26:39 So I use my. Kadir 26:40 Umm.P2 26:41 I use ChatGPT for like a lot of things in my work, but yeah, MyAI not that much. Kadir 26:45 Hmm. Umm uh, yeah, I think this is this is pretty helpful. So I remember you also were telling about you use ChatGPT on your desktop and then MyAI on your phone so. P2 27:01 Umm. Kadir 27:05 Other than kind of like categorizing you said ChatGPT, for more formal stuff for more. Maybe professional stuff versus check MyAI, more personal, maybe more lightweight. P2 27:16 Yes. Yeah. Kadir 27:17 So what characteristics? What characteristics of MyAI leads to that kind of like perception or perspective for you? P2 27:32 Uh, so yeah, if you like, look at some of the things, some of the screenshots. So the way that MyAI reply is, so it's like pretty like informal, if you see uses like worse like oops, my bad something like that. Kadir 27:42 Uh. P2 27:46 So the things that you use and in like daily conversation with the friends and all so and it it is like kind of like what do you say expressive of its emotion? I think so because like it it kind of like if I tell it that it is wrong, then it says like, oops, I'm..I'm so sorry for that. Something like that. Kadir 28:03 Umm. P2 28:04 We don't see in terms if you did that often, so eventually like give a prompt, then it will just say something formally. So I think this is the main reason why is why I said so. Kadir 28:14 More conversational features of language. Uh.P2 28:18 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kadir 28:19 Supposed in my AI any have you? I don't know. Like would you like to eligible bit comment on any. Like interface features like any features that MyAI has, make it more personal or versus impersonal. P2 28:39 Interface features. Uh, I think it's just like chatting with a friend right in MyAI. So if you if you have seen the interface of my AI so it's like exactly the same as like other Snapchat chats. Kadir 28:47 OK. P2 28:56 And so it has like a place to, like, upload your pictures or something like that. Send a sticker, sticker or even like voice memos, which you don't see in ChatGPT. Kadir 29:03 Umm. P2 29:04 So yeah, I think that all the interface is is it is like making it is like designed to be like your personal friend or assistant like that's what I feel. Kadir 29:15 OK. OK, deﬁnitely indeﬁnitely. That makes sense. So I think you said this, you saw some ads or sponsored content while interacting with MyAI. P2 29:30 Mm-hmm. Kadir 29:30 And then you're feeling was OK. I'm skipping this question because you already kind of responded to that, sorry. So in terms of in your conversation with my I, how reliable do you ﬁnd the responses by MyAI? P2 29:51 Reliable. Kadir 29:52 Yeah. Do you think the responses from my AI have reliable they are. P2 29:57So far I don't think I can see that I can answer this question right now because I haven't like cross checked, but it uh answered me because I actually to like give me an itinerary with all the pricing and the budgeting. But I haven't like looked into how accurate that was really. But I know from the fact that it gave me like wrong information on the soccer ﬁelds, so I would say not that reliable. Kadir 30:21 Hmm. Yeah. With soccer cleats I? When I looked at your screenshots, umm for all the options it was offering giving the same price right? P2 30:33 Yeah, I I told it like it. My budget is like $150.00 and give me a price range for all of the soccer cleats, but I think it it all showed the same pricing like $150.00 for everything yeah. Kadir 30:47 And then it's kind of like a question mark, I I see, like I, yeah, so you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI, for example, I've seen a you you share your picture with the chat, but what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by MyAI on Snapchat or by Snapchat let's say? P2 30:49 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, I I couldn't get the last part like that. Good. Can you like repeat that again? Kadir 31:20 Sure you shared. Let me quickly be we're waiting. You might have shared something personal when interacting with the my AI chat bot and what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by Snapchat. P2 31:38 Used by Snapchat. Kadir 31:40 Yeah. P2 31:42 I don't think I have, like, ever thought of thought it. So what I think what do you want me to say in that regard? If my information or like pictures are used by the Snapchat itself, the Snapchat app or like my AI in a different way, is like going to be what you say public on the Internet or something like that. I couldn't get the question completely so. Kadir 32:08 Umm. P2 32:41OK, it's alright. Yeah, I'm not that concerned because all everything like you say right now or in the modern day world like they know it all, I think so they can like hear us like through our phones. And so if you look at the ads given by Facebook is like kind of even if I speak in [home country language] with my friend, it kind of latches onto that and shows me the air of the same thing in Facebook. Kadir 33:09 OK. P2 33:11 So I think our data is being like sold everywhere right now. So I I don't mind. I don't mind it. I..I'm not that concerned about it. Kadir 33:26 OK, I think I this is totally fair. I think this kind of brings us to the end of our conversation. Do you have anything at the very end to add or to emphasize before we hung up? P2 33:44 No, not really. P2 35:08 Nice to meet you, buddy. Kadir 35:11 Yeah. Shristi 35:11 OK, I'll stop the recording. Kadir 35:11 Nice to meet you too. Shristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P5_Interview March 27, 2024 Shristi 0:05 Can you please tell me a little bit about yourself? P5 0:19 Uh, so I'm P5. I'm from Nepal and I'm currently a freshman here in ISU from Biology department. Shristi 0:27 So can you tell me what social media platforms you use currently? P5 0:36 I use a lot of social media platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok Shristi 0:46 So do you remember when you did you start using Snapchat? P5 0:51 Yeah. And that was really long ago, I think. I think I started using it since like 2017 or 18. Shristi 1:00 So maybe when you were a high schooler , high schooler? P5 1:04 No. When I was in Grade 7 or 8. Shristi 1:06 Oh, so you were in in middle school? P5 1:08 Yeah, but like I didn't not use it to interact with people, but just to like take snaps and like picture. Shristi 1:15 Ohh I know for the filters. P5 1:18 Yeah. Shristi 1:18 Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I used to do that too when I was in.P5 1:21 Yeah, I did that.I just started using it for like interacting with people since I was in grade 11. Shristi 1:28 Ohh great 11. That's interesting. Yeah, I really used to like some filters on Instagram. P5 1:34 Yeah.The one with the flowers and it. Shristi 1:37 Ohh yeah, I know what you mean. Shristi 1:37 OK, so currently , what do you do the most on in on Snapchat? P5 1:47 Umm, so I love taking snaps. I love taking pictures and the filters are like so good nowadays.And the other thing is I love to maintain streaks with my friends. So if this streaks is gonna like end, I'm gonna like call him or text him saying have and I. And I. Sometimes I talk to them like it's private, so I think I use the Snapchat for more personal and private conversations because it just like goes away in a day. Shristi 2:18 Yeah, makes sense. Did you use the Snapchat in my AI feature before this study? P5 2:30 Yeah, I did. Shristi 2:31 OK. So can you tell me when and why you started using it in the past? P5 2:36 Oh, I don't know . I just like it was new to me. I didn't know it existed, but like it one day it suddenly appeared. So I was just like watching Tik Toks and like people were sharing screenshots about what they're talking and I wanted to try it. So I just like started talking to it and I don't know , I wanted to try if it knows various languages. So I started talking to the AI in Nepali and it did know Nepali language. I just.had fun. I used to like say so random things to the AI and it yeah, it just used to respond. I loved it. Shristi 3:19 So can you give me an example of how you have used this feature my AI? It can be an example from the study or it can be something outside of it.P5 3:32 Umm, I think I use it when I need like recommendations. When I'm going to a new place and I don't know what I'm gonna do, like if I'm hungry or something and I don't know where to eat, I just open Snapchat and ask it like, yeah. Shristi 3:38 OK, so do you also use the recommendation that it makes? P5 3:55 Yeah, I do. It sends me like four or five recommendations. So I check the all of them and then I just go to some place with higher reviews. Shristi 4:07 Umm so. How frequently do you think you have used my AI? Have you used it multiple times or have you tried it like once or twice? P5 4:21 Uh, when it first came, I used to like talk to almost like, twice or thrice a week, whenever I feel felt bored. But now I don't use it much because I don't have time. Shristi 4:49 I think you have found my AI useful for recommendations. So is there anything else you have found my AI useful for? P5 4:55 Uh, I think when I really do like vent something when I'm mad or like when I'm sad about something and I don't wanna talk to it about anyone else, I just try to talk to the AI because obviously it doesn't, you know , like it doesn't share my information to anybody and all. So when I do that I I think I like it because it it sends me like so many positive messages which I think helps me to cheer up my mood. Shristi 5:24 Umm, yeah, yeah, I think I could get where you're coming from? Because I think if you talk about it, you share it with something. So it's just you talking to the AI. I think the will go away after a while, so I think it's more. P5 5:41 And also when I'm like not feeling pretty , I just what I do is I just send my snap or like a picture to the AI and it's like you're so pretty . You're you're looking amazing and all. And I feel good. So yeah. Shristi 5:57 Hmm you like the AI hyping you off. P5 5:59 Yeah, I like it.Shristi 6:00 Can you share me an experience where you found that my AI met your expectations? P5 6:17 I think it actually like does meet my expectations, like all the time, because when I really need a recommendation, when I really need to know what things I need to do here. Like if I don't know anything about a place or or if I don't know anything about a certain food, whether I should like, try it or not, then when I asked the AI it just like gives everything. What I need to know , so I think it does like carry out on my like expectations so. Shristi 6:51 OK, sounds good. So can you share me an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations? P5 7:02 Ohh that was when I that was like before this study . I think I was back in Nepal at that time and I needed to like go to someplace new in Kathmandu itself. But when I asked the AI about it, it was showing me exact same thing like all the time. It was showing me like four or five places. But I actually needed to know new places, but it was just showing me the common ones [in Kathmandhu]. I already knew about it. I already went there.I didn't like it wanted to tell me those things. Shristi 7:42 Uh, so I think it was just repeating the same five places that everybody knows about in Kathmandu.. P5 7:50 Yeah, it was just repeating all the time. Shristi 7:52 So your intention, I think for asking that would be finding new places that maybe you know like it's not known by everybody . P5 7:57 Yeah, like if I ask it for the first time and it shows something, uh, I don't want it to show the same thing the second time or the third time. Shristi 8:13 I know what you mean because like if it shows if you're telling it to do something new and if it's throwing you the same thing and you will get, yeah, it can get frustrating. Shristi 8:21 Thank you for sharing that. So in general, because I think you have used my AI for quitea long time and I think you use it regularly , even outside of the study . So in your opinion, how much effort do you think using my AI needs? P5 8:43 I don't think it needs much effort because you can just steal it like anything you wanted. It understands, but sometimes what it does is you're talking about a certain topic and and you know , like if I ask if I'm asking you about something and it says another thing and I am asking the about the same topic but a different thing like a different thing about the exact same topic that we were talking about before. What it does is it like suddenly changes the topic. Shristi 9:17 Umm, I think you know what you mean. I think one of the screenshots that you have uploaded when you were playing the game with it. So you go off to a tangent and talk about something else and you want to complete the game with it has forgotten about it, uh. P5 9;24 Yeah, it just like completely jumps off to another topic and it's hard. Like I don't wanna explain something again and again to it like I it's. I don't like typing. I don't even like send text to my parents because I don't like typing at all.But when it does that, it just gets frustrating because I don't wanna explain it to like explain the same thing again and again. Shristi 9:54 Yeah, makes sense. So in terms of any skill set that is required to use my AI well, do you think there are any skills that are needed? P5 10:07 I don't think it's that important, but I think you need to like know how to actually carry on the conversation like you need to know what you're talking about, because it might suddenly change the topics and it might give you some advices which are not related to it. And if you don't know what you're talking about, it might take a completely different turn. Shristi 10:36 Umm, so it's it's more about OK how do you post the questions and how do you reply to it? P5 10:45 Yep. And sometimes it is like if the structure of the sentence doesn't like match to what you're trying to say, it just answers you about like completely different thing. Shristi 11:00 So. I'm taking it as is, you know , like you should have like basic English writing skills. It understands you well.P5 11:11 You should have the knowledge of grammars. Shristi 11:13 Makes sense. OK, so for using the my AI chat bot will do you think you have the necessary skills or know-how on how to get get it to. So do you have the skills or know-how to make it work well? P5 11:42 Yeah, I think I do. I usually talk a lot, like even to people, so I don't think it's hard for me to talk to the AI because when I open Snapchat and I decide to talk to the AI, I pretty much know what I want to talk about and what answers I want. So even if it answers me wrong or like even if it tells me about something else, I just tell it like, no, I don't mean this. I want to know about something else and you're wrong. So I think after that it gives me the answer that I want. Shristi 12:18 OK, so you're usually not dropping the conversation, but you are just giving it enough context to give you the right answers. P5 12:26 Yeah. I just asked something which I want to know about like except the recommendations things for recommendation. I don't know about anything, so I just ask it, but for other things I think I just ask it what I want to know . Like I want the confirmation that what I'm doing is right. Shristi 12:48 Umm, so I think you talked about one obstacle already , which is it forgetting about what conversation you were having and going somewhere else. But apart from that, do you have you found other obstacles when you were trying to talk with my AI? P5 13:07 I don't think there are much obstacles. Yeah, I remember one thing. So whenever like I talked to him, I I talked to AI about something. It just sends me a paragraph like a whole paragraph. It's like 5-6 sentences and that's like I don't wanna read it like I just want one sentence. I just want a clear answer and it sends me so much I think, yeah. Shristi 13;37 Oh yeah, I know what you mean, because I think it on the phone, it looks very difficult to reed when they have like a para. P5 13:44 Yeah, not like, very difficult, but even if it's like short things, even if it's two sentences or three sentences, it looks like a big paragraph in the phone because they screen issmall. So it looks quite like intermediating to even read it because it looks so big. I don't wanna read it. I hate reading stuff and I like it. Shristi 14:07 That totally makes sense. Yeah, I do remember one other thing that happened with you. I think in the shopping task where you asked, I think something about iPhone 15 and it said it didn't exist. So what do you think about that? P5 14:20 I didn't know that it didn't know because I thought it's like computer viz. So like it has to have every single information like every new information, right? So I thought it knew already , but when I asked about it, it was like it hasn't even released it and I was like, what do you mean? They're gonna release iphone 16! I was shocked that it didn't know . Shristi 14:46 OK, so when when that happened, do you like, did you like tell it that? Ohh, they're releasing it? Or or did you just like drop the conversation? P5 14:57 I I didn't ask it because at that time I was like, so sleepy . I didn't wanna like talk. I didn't wanna send anything else, like I didn't want to hold on the conversation for too long, and I knew if I did that, if I asked that question, it was gonna be long. So I didn't ask about it. Yeah, I didn't wanna explain. Shristi 15:13 OK, so you didn't wanna take the trouble of explaining and and uh, OK, makes sense. P5 15:19 Yeah, I didn`t wanna explain. Shristi 15:22 UM and four UM, I think just as you said, there are some times when problems arise when you're using it, it forgets the conversation or it does not have the details. Or sometimes it might give the you know wrong information, so when that happens, do you feel you have access to any necessary resources or support to use it properly? P5 15:36 So like in the MyAI, like in the Snapchat itself or outside it? Shristi 15:40 In the Snapchat itself or or somewhere outside where you can look up information. P5 15:44 Umm, I think it like when it does that. I think I go directly to Google and ask it, but sometimes when I ask the AI about the same thing like the thing that it got wrong, I think it like apologizes and says like I'm gonna search for it again and it sends me the correctinformation in third time or something. But I like to. I like to go to Google and search it because I don't trust it. Shristi 16:17 So I think you've already umm, I think touched on it a little bit that you saw TikToks about, you know , people talking with my AI when it first came out. So in addition to the TikToks, have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet. P5 16:41 Yeah, I have. I think my most of my friends use it sometimes, like not regularly but sometimes and before I told them they didn't actually use it. But when I told them that it also knows other languages and if you want to talk, talk to the AI in your own language, I think you can do it so like they tried it and they loved it too, like when we're bored or something like that. We just go to AI and ask those stupid things. Shristi So so for the AI, have you for the AI, I think yes, you encouraged other people, but have you ever been encouraged by other people to use my AI? Or it could be something that other people posted. What did you use end up using my AI because of the Tik Toks? . P5 17:06 Yeah, like nobody particularly told me to use it. I just used it because I saw some videos and it looked like fun, so yeah. Shristi 17:46 So for you are so because I think you have been using it for a certain period of time already . Have you noticed any changes in your social media habit after you started using my AI? P5 18:07 Uh, not much, but I think when I because now I haven't, like, used it as much as I did before. I don't have free time, but I still use other social media so I don't know it just when I just talked to my AI it makes me forget about other things. So I just keep using the AI and then I sleep on time. So I like that about it. I think yeah, it just makes me forget about everything. Everything else does not know the Instagram, the Facebook and everything else. I just forget that they exist. Shristi 18:49 Umm, so it's more like you know when you're trying to sleep, but you still wanna like scroll through the feeds or talk to other people. It's it's something that you talk to instead of doing other things so that you can slowly fall asleep. Is that what you're saying? P5 19:03 Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I do that because talking to my AI is like sometimes it's boring. So if if I ask about some educational things or something to it, it start explainingeverything and I feel so bored. I just. I just think no, I'd rather sleep. So I just like close my phone and I sleep. Shristi 19:25 That's that's, I think the most creative thing I've heard trying to sleep trying to get help for sleeping with my. That's cool. P5 19:35 Because I can. I can literally not sleep. I tried everything. If I start scrolling, I just keep scrolling it until it's two or three, and even when I try to sleep, uh, with some music on, I started dancing. So I'd rather use that. I just could not sleep with music on so. Shristi 20:03 OK, I I know what you mean because I think because for some people try to put music on and then just dose off. But then you love the music so much that you just going along with the songs. P5 20:13 Yeah, like I. Also, because like I normally don't do music I I don't listen to music all the time. But when I do listen to music, I just love listening to it and I keep listening to it unless I cannot. So I just cannot sleep and yeah, and when I when I try to learn about some educational things, I just fell asleep. Like I don't want to study so definitely I feel I feel sleepy and then I just decide. No, I'd rather sleep. Shristi 20:46 So have you been using or have used in the past something that is similar to my AI? P5 20:56 There's like ChatGPT . Makes sense? Shristi 21:02 Yeah, makes sense. P5 21:04 I've used that I've used that. I use it even now, but I don't trust it like at all. It gave me wrong answers like so many times. Shristi 21:15 ChatGPT or MyAI? P5 21:18 Chat GPT Shristi 21:21 OK! So did it give you wrong answers for like academic stuff?P5 21:24 Yeah. Shristi 21:25 Yeah, totally makes sense when it like, confidently gives you the wrong answer . You don't even know about it. Yeah. P5 21:27 Nowadays what I do is like a first Snapchat. I just talk to you about personal stuff like or something that's happening to me or something fun. But for academic stuff, I just use chat GPT in place of SnapChat, because I just think that makes more sense. I don't know why, but nowadays I'm like if I ask one question to the chat GPT I asked him the same question twice to make sure because I don't trust it at all. it made so many mistakes. So what I do is I ask the question and answers me and I and I said like Are you sure? And it's like it, it does it again and then it gets something. And then I and then again this really correct and then it gives me another answer . So I don't trust it. Shristi 22:38 OK, so you just make sure by giving it like by making it a try for like multiple times so that you know you got the right answer . OK, makes sense. P5 22:43 Yeah, sometimes even that is wrong. Shristi 22:46 OK, so yeah, connecting to that in your experience, do you feel that there are some similarities between my AI and ChatGPT? P5 23:03 Yeah, there are similarities. Like they both answer to you, if you have some questions you just ask it to like both of like Snapchat, my AI and the chat GPT and it just answers you. I think that's the similar thing. Yeah, it's the same. Not not act exactly same, but it is similar . Shristi 23:28 So what do you think are the differences between my AI versus ChatGPT? P5 23:39 I think for ChatGPT is like more it's. I don't know . I think it's serious like because it doesn't have, you know , it's it's technically made for academic stuff. So I think that's more sophisticated. I don't know if that's the right word, but yeah. But, MyAI is so chill; we can use We can use emojis with it. We can we can use anything. It's like more fun and personal, so if you ask me I when I have to talk about myself or like something I need or or something personal, I would choose MyAI. But if I have to learn aboutsomething or if I have to ask questions about academic stuff and educational stuff. I would rather use ChatGPT . Shristi 24:37 Umm, so when you are talking with MyAI, have you ever seen ads or sponsored content? P5 24:47 Yeah. Once or twice, not not much, but I have seen him once or twice because when I ask when I ask about recommendations, sometimes what it does it like it sends uh, you know , first what? I don't know if it's it can be called add or not, but uh it sends me like four or five recommendations and for one of them it also sends like the whole poster thing. Shristi 25:15 Ohh OK, so it sounds you extra information? P5 25:17 Not extra information, but like, especially when uh asking over like restaurants or brands or something first, I don't know , like it it doesn't do it all the time, but sometimes what it does is it is it sends you know the like poster of the restaurant thing like with menus sometime menus and all and the prices and everything. It doesn't do it for every everything, but sometimes I don't know what happens. It just sends like randomly like random restaurant. Shristi 26:00 Umm, OK, so when you are talking with it and you suddenly see a sponsored content or like an ad, so how does that usually make you feel? P5 26:01 I don't think it's like that bad because it's not like the YouTube ads or something. It just sends it and it forgets about it. So like the topic gets carried on, so I don't think it does much. Yeah, I don't think it even matters. Shristi 26:25 I think we have talked about the trust thing related to ChatGPT already , but connecting it more to MyAI. How reliable do you find the responses by my AI? P5 26:48 I think it's quite like when I need personal like suggestions or I even talked to it when I'm kind of feeling low because it just like hikes me up suddenly and it gives so many positive affirmations. So I think it's quite reliable, especially for people who are feeling like low, who are kind of in the verse of, you know , going into depression or something. I think it and it answers you in such a way that it makes you feel validated and like it makes you feel like you are, you know , you're not wrong. I don't know it's reliable in that aspect, but for some aspect like for umm, if you ask certain like questions specificquestions which has like specific answers to it, sometimes it does give you wrong answers. Shristi 27:28 OK, so for example, if you're, I don't know , like looking for a place recommendations or maybe yeah, just the phone thing, right. It got it wrong. So for those kinds of tasks. So if for example you need to like find place of like plan a trip or buy something, do you trust MyAI`s responses related to those tasks? P5 28:12 Yeah, most of the time, I do trust it, but sometimes what I like to do is search it up and, like, ask to the MyAI and then go to the Google and search about it by myself. Like because some of them information might be wrong. Yeah, let's say 80%, yeah. Shristi 28:30 So so you just, OK, so you use the MyAI responses as like the starting point and do your own research, yeah. P5 28:38 Yeah, because I just, I I just don't think that I can go to a certain place that it recommended without looking for like anything else because that might be anything I might not like it or something. So I trusted but like not 100%. Shristi 29:01 Umm, so building on the trust thing because I am so you might have shared something personal or or you might do it on a regular basis when you share a personal things with MyAI. So what are your concerns if there are any regarding the information that you are sharing is used by the company or just Snapchat in general? P5 29:33 So I'm type of person who's open to sharing everything? Like I don't mind if everybody knows what's going on in my life. I just feel like sometimes, even when I'm like, feeling very low or, you know , I just carry on with my life and I think sharing that thing with other people might make them inspired or something, you know , like, just make them feel like they're not alone in that. So I don't mind if my information is used by the company , but like I'm sometimes I'm also scared that the personal matters that I shared with Might be like publicized or something. I just sometimes it's just like random thoughts. Shristi 30:25 Umm, so when you were just being the devil's advocate and just imagining the worst case possible. P5 30:27 Yeah, I'm scared of that thing. But I still like I don't share like very, very, very important things with MyAI. But the things which are I think OK, even if it gets publicized or something, I just share those stuff.Shristi 30:50 So yeah, uh, those where the prospective questions that I had. Thank you so much for answering everything so much in detail. So before we leave, do you have anything to talk about in MyAI which you think we left in our conversation? P5 31:12 I don't know , but I think, yeah, I realized one thing that like when I when I asked about like recommendation for a filter it sends me like so bad filter like that was bad. Shristi 31:22 Ohh I do remember it. Ohh I thought I would ask you about it. So I think you told it like ohh I don't like this culture or something. And then it opt apologize. P5 31:37 Yeah, like it was not bad. I liked the filter but I don't wanna use the dog filter all the time. I mean, I know about it. I just don't wanna use it. It's like childish or something. We just use it for fun. When when we would like small children, I just. I didn't like it. Shristi 31:56 That was liking the first filter that was super popular . P5 32:05 Yeah. And when I said can you send me something else? I don't like it. It sent me another filter which is the same thing like the dog filter itself. Shristi 32:11 Ohh OK, so it was the same filter. P5 32:14 Yeah, I felt like it was obsessed with dogs. I don't think, yeah. Shristi 32:21 Makes sense. Yeah, I think that that could be like one of the experiences where you're like it's not, yeah. Shristi 32:32 OK. So yeah, thank you so much for being a part of the interview .\", \"Transcript P1_Interview March 11, 2024, 7:05PM Shristi 0:07 Ok. OK, so we have started the recording and transcription. I just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself? P1 0:21 Sure. Umm. So my name is [--]. I'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program. This is my second to last semester. Umm before that I'm. I'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years. Decided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer. Shristi 1:02 Umm, thank you. So which social media platforms are using currently? P1 1:10 Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok. Shristi 1:22 And Tiktok. OK umm so. Umm. So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so? P1 1:31 Umm. Shristi 1:38 Do you remember when you started using Snapchat? P1 1:41 Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I ﬁrst started using it.And I was deﬁnitely a lot more active on it early on. I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much. And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories. Shristi 2:15 Umm. P1 2:20 So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much. And my friends aren't. I don't go it on it too much anymore. I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing. Shristi 2:36 Umm. OK. So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera? P1 2:51 Yeah. So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notiﬁcations from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories. Shristi 3:16 OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family? P1 3:23 I do. It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while. Shristi 3:30 Yeah, and. P1 3:34 And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot. So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends. Like if I think of them every once in a while.Shristi 3:54 Hmm. OK, makes sense. So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study? P1 4:03 Umm, I actually have not used it. I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my ﬁrst thought was like I really had no interest in trying it. Umm. Shristi 4:20 Yeah. OK. P1 4:21 It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it. Like back when it was ﬁrst released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out. Shristi 4:53 Yeah, yeah, of course. Ohm. So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now. P1 5:06 Umm. Shristi 5:06 Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI? So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went. P1 5:23 Sure. Shristi 5:27 If you remember it. P1 5:29 Yeah. So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?Shristi 5:35 Yeah, of course. P1 5:37 OK, sure. So the one I remember the most was my ﬁrst time using it. Umm. And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US. Shristi 5:56 Umm. P1 6:00 And so for that one. I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me. Shristi 6:07 Umm. P1 6:08 Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good. Shristi 6:16 Mm-hmm. P1 6:16 So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar. So like I think the ﬁrst thing I said was like, hi, how are you? Shristi 6:28 Umm. P1 6:32 Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model. Shristi 6:41 No. P1 6:42 So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that. And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.And I've noticed that my like conversation. No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back. Well, at ﬁrst I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts. P1 8:15 Umm. So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions. Shristi 8:34 Umm. P1 8:35 And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the ﬁnal recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night. So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary. I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by. Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days. Shristi 9:30 Umm. P1 9:45 And I'm like, I don't know about that. Shristi 9:48 Yeah.P1 9:48 And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources. Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in. Shristi 10:46 Mm-hmm. P1 10:46 And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore. Shristi 10:55 Yeah. P1 10:58 Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like. Shristi 10:59 Umm, you know? P1 11:02 I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip. Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was ﬁne. Shristi 11:14 Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else. P1 11:27 Yeah. Shristi 11:28 So yeah, so much for sharing that. So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?P1 11:37 Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better. Shristi 12:24 Umm. P1 12:24 Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me? And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary. Shristi 12:40 Umm. P1 12:43 A recommendation was deﬁnitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker. Shristi 13:01 Umm. Umm, OK, thank you. So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back? P1 13:34 Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation. I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time. Shristi 13:55 Hmm hmm. P1 14:06 Umm. Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option. Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should havelike asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews. Shristi 14:52 Mm-hmm. P1 14:56 Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products. Shristi 15:10 Yep. P1 15:11 It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that. Shristi 15:30 Umm. Given of course. OK, makes sense. So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot? P1 15:46 Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time. Shristi 16:30 Umm OK. P1 16:33 So pretty effortless. Shristi 16:36 OK. So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well? P1 16:47 Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.Shristi 17:00 Umm. P1 17:01 You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations. Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed. And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human. Shristi 17:42 Umm. P1 17:44 So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it. Shristi 17:52 OK, so did you encounter any speciﬁc obstacles when you were using the tool? P1 18:05 And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones. Shristi 18:29 Hmm. So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers? P1 18:43 Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh. Shristi 18:49 OK. P1 18:52 OK. Can you guys hear me alright? Shristi 18:54 Yeah, we do. P1 18:56Uh, yeah. So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like. Can you give me links with pictures? So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing. But in other times. I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like speciﬁc models of backpacks within this brand and like speciﬁc colors. It then gave me speciﬁc models but not speciﬁc colors. Shristi 20:00 Umm. OK. Makes sense. So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the speciﬁc feature properly. P1 20:27 Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it. Shristi 20:50 OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it. P1 21:12 Umm. Shristi 21:14 So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard? P1 21:18 Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it. Shristi 21:48 Umm. P1 21:48 Uh, or like banter with it? And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one speciﬁcally, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out. Shristi 22:32 Oh really? P1 22:33 Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm. Shristi 22:43 Umm. P1 22:46 Umm. And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it. That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer. Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers. Shristi 23:07 Yeah. P1 23:11 Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing. Shristi 23:21 Yeah. P1 23:23 So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people. Shristi 23:28 OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it? P1 23:43 Umm, I would say no. Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny. But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing. Shristi 24:10Makes sense. Ohm so. So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone? P1 24:26 Umm. I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh. What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it. Shristi 25:28 Umm. P1 25:36 So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever. Shristi 25:36 Umm. P1 25:41 Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all. Shristi 25:45 Yeah, makes sense. P1 25:49 Yeah. Shristi 25:50 So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI? P1 26:04 No, I I don't think so. Shristi 26:07 Hmm, OK. So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI? P1 26:21 I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.Shristi 26:27 Umm so so. P1 26:28 Which is just, yeah. Shristi 26:30 Hmm. So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT. So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines? P1 26:49 Umm. I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example. Shristi 27:20 Mm-hmm. Umm. P1 27:29 Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others. Shristi 28:21 Umm. Umm yeah, sure. So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have? P1 28:40 I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm. I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure. Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need. And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not speciﬁcally asking likethe Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like. Shristi 29:51 Umm. OK. Makes sense. Umm. So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things? P1 30:08 Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this. Shristi 30:22 Umm. P1 30:31 Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere. Shristi 30:35 Umm. P1 30:36 Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different. Shristi 31:06 Yeah, I think that's that's fair. So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads? P1 31:19 Umm. Ohh no, I don't think so. Shristi 31:28 Ohh OK really OK. P1 31:30 Yeah. Shristi 31:32 Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding backand giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least. P1 31:48 Yeah. Shristi 31:49 And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat? P1 32:02 Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin. Shristi 32:10 OK. Yeah. P1 32:11 Yeah. Shristi 32:11 So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed. P1 32:15 It just knows, yeah. Shristi 32:17 Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then. OK, so so when you receive any recommendations. So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that? P1 32:42 Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way. Shristi 33:06 OK, makes sense. P1 33:08 Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.Shristi 33:29 Mm-hmm. P1 33:33 It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not. Shristi 33:45 Umm. Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you ﬁnish the conversation. P1 33:53 I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that. Shristi 34:11 Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry. P1 34:42 Uh, yeah. Shristi 34:42 Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reﬂect back on that experience a little bit for us? P1 34:53 Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to ﬂy? Shristi 35:15 This is. P1 35:20 And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke. Shristi 35:27 Umm. Yeah.P1 35:32 And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it. Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes? And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it. Shristi 36:11 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously. P1 36:22 Yeah. Shristi 36:24 Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you ﬁlters. P1 36:34 Ohh yeah. Shristi 36:34 Ohm, I'm so. So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us? P1 36:42 Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like. P1 36:56 Ask it to recommend a ﬁlter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and ﬁrst of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway. Shristi 37:00 Umm. Umm. P1 37:11 So I don't know what that was about. Shristi 37:15 OK.P1 37:16 But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a ﬁlter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat ﬁlter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the ﬁlter homepage. Shristi 37:45 Umm. P1 37:47 Of the camera like tab. Shristi 37:49 The where we where we take, where we take new snaps. P1 37:53 Yeah. Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the ﬁlters. Shristi 38:00 Umm. P1 38:00 It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that speciﬁc cat ﬁlter. Shristi 38:04 That OK. Umm, so. So when you were not able to reach the speciﬁc ﬁlter, how how did it make you feel at the time? P1 38:19 You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this ﬁlter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah. Shristi 38:45 Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right. P1 38:49 Yeah. Mm-hmm. Shristi 38:51 OK. Yeah, makes sense. OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more speciﬁc I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you ﬁnd the responses by MyAI? P1 39:17 Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual? Shristi 39:24 Yeah. In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes? P1 39:45 Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times. So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to. Shristi 40:11 Umm. P1 40:31 But I wouldn't take it at face value. Shristi 40:38 Yeah, right. P1 40:40 And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other? Shristi 41:01 Umm. P1 41:01 Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account? Does it know how expensive it is? Shristi 41:09 Umm. P1 41:11 Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?Shristi 41:15 Yeah. P1 41:16 It's like for like minute details. I I would do that research on my own. Shristi 41:23 Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with. P1 41:34 Basically, yeah. Shristi 41:35 Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those? P1 42:11 Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself? Shristi 42:37 I mean. P1 42:41 So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself. Shristi 42:52 Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reﬂecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for? P1 43:16 Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively. Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to ﬁgure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality orsomething to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future. Shristi 44:02 OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and. Kadir 44:05 I have a quick question. I have a quick question. P1 44:09 Yeah. Kadir 44:09 Just before ﬁnishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate. P1 44:24 Umm. Kadir 44:27 I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that? P1 44:54 Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference. Kadir 45:13 Umm. P1 45:13 Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human. And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even. Kadir 45:29 Hmm. P1 45:32 Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the SnapchatAI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT. Kadir 46:06 Umm. Shristi 46:12 No. Yeah. Kadir 46:14 Hmm. Hmm, yeah. Shristi 46:17 Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for speciﬁcally for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for? P1 46:37 Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned? Shristi 47:01 Umm. P1 47:01 I'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games. Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it. Shristi 47:09 Umm. P1 47:11 Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games. Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or. Shristi 47:28 Umm. P1 47:30 If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.Shristi 47:49 Umm. P1 47:59 So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case. Kadir 48:07 Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here. Shristi 48:14 Umm. Kadir 48:17 That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that? P1 48:47 Uh, could you say that again? So like uh? Kadir 48:51 Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings. P1 49:09 Yes. Kadir 49:26 As far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong. P1 49:27 Yes. Kadir 49:29 And how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI? P1 49:49Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine. Kadir 50:07 Mm-hmm. P1 50:08 That's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations. Kadir 50:13 Umm. P1 50:15 And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more. Kadir 50:29 Umm. P1 50:40 Or, uh, like like human? Like so. Kadir 50:46 Umm. P1 50:46 Like if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know. Like why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers. Kadir 50:54 Umm. Yeah. Thanks very much. P1 51:07 Yeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted. Kadir 51:13 Ohh wait, you're you're muted. Shristi 51:16 I do it all the time. I'm sorry.P1 51:18 Yeah, yeah. Shristi 51:19 So yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention? P1 51:30 No, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun. Thanks for inviting me to participate. Shristi 51:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Kadir 51:37 Deﬁnitely. Shristi 51:37 Yeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK Shristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P3_Interview March 21, 2024 Shristi started transcription Kadir 0:12 OK, perfect. So let's start then. The recording has started. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? P3 0:26 Yeah. So my my full name is [P3]. I'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally . Kadir 0:46 OK. OK, senior in microbiology and genetics. P3 0:49 Yes. Kadir 0:50 OK and. What social media platforms do you use? P3 0:58 Ohm. More often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah. Kadir 1:06 It's not OK. And when did you start using Snapchat? P3 1:18Ooh, I wanna say. 8-8 years ago or maybe 9? Kadir 1:27 Eight or nine years ago. P3 1:28 Umm. Kadir 1:28 OK. OK, that's good to know. Umm. And then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general? P3 1:40 Ohm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat. Kadir 1:51 Mm-hmm. P3 1:51 So yeah, just chatting with friends. Kadir 1:55 Friends. OK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them. P3 1:59 Umm. Kadir 2:01 OK. OK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes. Got it. P3 2:09 Yeah.Kadir 2:09 So and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature? P3 2:21 Umm. I wanna say, well, when did it do? You know when it began. Kadir 2:29 I. Shristi 2:30 I think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm. P3 2:32 A year ago. OK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much. Kadir 2:38 Umm, when it first launched you either did it and then did. P3 2:40 Umm. Kadir 2:43 Did you use? Since then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time. P3 2:52 I used it when it first came out and then I didn't. I guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again. Kadir 3:01 OK. That's fair and OK, so. P3 3:03 Yeah.Kadir 3:08 Just uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago. So can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI? Umm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences. Just a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please. P3 3:44 Yeah, I like. So with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for. Things to see in a specific place. So if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it. What places can I see or what places can I eat? And I like some of the suggestions that it gives. Kadir 4:05 Hmm. So mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions. OK. P3 4:10 Yeah. Kadir 4:10 Yeah. So make sense so. Do you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those? Recommendations for eating out or for a place to visit? P3 4:31 Yeah. So when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching. So then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.Kadir 4:50 Hmm. P3 4:52 So I liked that it kept that in mind. Kadir 4:54 OK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful? P3 5:08 Uh. OK, so if I were to put it on a scale of. Kadir 5:15 Mm-hmm. P3 5:16 I don't know one to five. I guess I would say. 2 1/2. Kadir 5:24 OK, in the middle. Mediocre. P3 5:25 Yeah, yeah. Kadir 5:28 OK. Is there any? P3 5:32 Reason. Kadir 5:33 Reason that led to this rating.P3 5:41 I just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague. Kadir 5:48 Hmm. P3 5:48 If I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it. Kadir 6:10 Hmm. Uh, OK, but. P3 6:16 So I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense. Kadir 6:42 Oh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations? P3 6:59 Umm. Sorry, let me think. Kadir 7:13 Yes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice. P3 7:24 Umm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations. I didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.Kadir 7:45 Umm. Umm. P3 7:49 Otherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do. Shristi 8:14 If it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff. P3 8:21 Yeah, that helps. Shristi 8:26 Yeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like. P3 8:31 OK Ohh now I remember . OK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake. Kadir 9:00 Umm. P3 9:01 So I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that. Kadir 9:09 OK, OK. Yeah. Standing so. How much effort was required to use my AI chatbot? Uh. During your experiences? P3 9:27 Umm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about. To being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.Umm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't. Kadir 10:05 Umm. P3 10:07 But yeah, I would say so. Kadir 10:09 OK. P3 10:11 A little bit of effort, but not not much. Kadir 10:14 Not much, OK. OK. Umm do you think? If any special skills are needed to use my AI chatbot well. P3 10:35 Umm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI. Kadir 10:45 Hmm. If I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]? Can, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want. So and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require? P3 11:18 Umm, so could you repeat that question? Kadir 11:23 I'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question. You said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want. And was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?P3 11:48 Ohh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it. Kadir 12:05 Umm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI? P3 12:24 Umm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK. Kadir 12:45 Right. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK. P3 12:55 Yeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant. Kadir 13:17 Yeah. P3 13:17 And I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine. And then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad. It was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but. Kadir 13:38 Umm. P3 13:38 But I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice. Kadir 13:46 Umm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?P3 13:59 Ohh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out. Could you repeat that? Kadir 14:07 Sure. Do you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly? P3 14:21 Ohm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI. Kadir 14:31 Mm-hmm. P3 14:35 But if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI. Kadir 14:44 OK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else? P3 15:04 Ohm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture. I don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI. Kadir 15:39 Mm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that. P3 15:53 Yeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.Kadir 16:02 Mm-hmm. P3 16:02 Umm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation. Kadir 16:12 Umm. Hmm. It seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human. Uh. Features. P3 16:32 Yeah, yeah. Kadir 16:35 OK. U], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII? P3 16:46 Ohm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI. So then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you? Kadir 17:02 Hmm. P3 17:08 I don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do. And I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that. Kadir 17:21 Yeah.P3 17:25 When it first came out. Kadir 17:27 OK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms. P3 17:37 Yeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it. Kadir 17:57 OK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm. On on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study. P3 18:20 I feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically . Kadir 18:53 Umm. P3 18:55 I think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very. How do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more. Kadir 19:29 Mm-hmm. P3 19:38 So it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.Kadir 19:46 OK, OK. Umm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI? P3 20:09 Gonna say that hasn't really changed. Kadir 20:13 OK. P3 20:13 How are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could. Kadir 20:19 OK. P3 20:28 It could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI. Kadir 20:40 OK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI? P3 20:54 Umm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know. Kadir 20:59 Mm-hmm. P3 21:04 Like if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand. Kadir 21:13 Mm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity ordifference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT. P3 21:43 I guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that. Kadir 22:33 Umm. Hmm. OK. Umm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with. Umm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your? Prompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them? P3 23:09 Oh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah. Kadir 23:12 Umm. P3 23:15 I felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary . Kadir 23:26 Mm-hmm. P3 23:31 Umm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time. Kadir 23:41 So it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a. P3 23:46 Umhm.Kadir 23:47 So you can't make it on and off. P3 23:51 Oh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off? Kadir 23:55 I don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either. P3 23:57 Ohh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links. I might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would. Kadir 24:07 What? P3 24:07 It would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright. Kadir 24:28 OK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it? Can I quickly ask? P3 24:41 Oh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright. Kadir 24:44 Yeah. Or you said you were watching it, right? P3 24:47 Oh, oh, no, no. I was just, uh, I just said Ohh. I think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip andthen that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after. Kadir 24:54 Yeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements. Also, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very? Generic. P3 25:27 I think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about. Kadir 25:33 Umm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses? P3 25:49 Well, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses. Kadir 26:02 Did you? Yeah. P3 26:02 So I I feel like it's probably 50-50. Kadir 26:06 Hmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers. P3 26:26 Umm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists. Kadir 26:39 OK.P3 26:43 But yeah, that that's all I really had the chance to look at. Kadir 26:48 And then what was your shopping experience by the way, can you remind that to us? Shopping task. P3 26:55 Yeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for. Kadir 27:08 Right. P3 27:09 I don't know places that I had really good deals. Kadir 27:13 OK. P3 27:15 And it was giving me. Kadir 27:15 Or yeah, yeah. P3 27:17 Ohh sorry what? Kadir 27:19 Stores,. You mean? Yeah. P3 27:20 Yeah. Kadir 27:20 I just remember , yeah. P3 27:22Yeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person. Kadir 27:35 Umm. P3 27:35 One of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah. Kadir 27:43 OK. OK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform? P3 28:15 Umm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached. I don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it. Kadir 28:41 Hmm. OK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense. Umm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly? P3 29:05 Ohm. I guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries. Even if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.Kadir 29:57 OK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more. P3 29:59 Yeah. Kadir 30:02 OK. Yeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again. Yeah. Thank you very much for attending us. I don't know if should see as a question or not, but. Shristi 30:15 Umm I I have a few more questions. I'll just go ahead and ask your. So do you see just to reel back a little bit? P3 30:20 OK. Shristi 30:25 So I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries. P3 30:47 Ohh yeah. Shristi 30:51 And then? You asked it. Hey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right? And then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it. And then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think. And it said, hey, what else is going on? Are there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshotsafter that? So did you, like, continue the conversation after that? Do you remember anything from that day regarding it? P3 31:24 Ohh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that? Shristi 31:42 Umm. P3 31:43 So I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like. Shristi 31:44 OK. Hmm. OK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new? Conversation starters. Uh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it. So how do you feel about that interaction in general? P3 32:15 Uh. I feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm. And when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person. Shristi 32:51 Umm OK. P3 32:52 So it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer. Shristi 32:57 Umm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or fivedifferent things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for. P3 33:36 I want to say it's good for. I mean, I keep bringing this up, but. Since I like food, I like exploring new food places. I like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even? Umm definitely. When I've tried to talk to ChatGPT. Yeah, it's just kind of curves me. It's like, OK, ask me the question now. And even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue. Having a conversation with you as long as you wanted to. Umm. What? It's bad for though. I'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate. If that mean it's even less accurate, there we go. In a lot of a lot of things. So I think that's what it's bad that. Shristi 34:46 Mm-hmm. Yeah, makes sense. Ohm. So I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left. I guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK. So final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly? P3 35:41 I wish there was. I don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.I don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for. It's just. I just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but. Because I I still didn't even know what it was for. Really, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for. Maybe. But even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for. If it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources. Shristi 36:29 Hmm. Yeah, makes sense. OK, I think that's all I had. So thank you so much. I'll. I'll pass it back to Kadir. Where you left it off. Kadir 36:45 Yeah. Thank you very much for. Yeah. Hating in our diary study. And so at the same time, and enjoy. Uh, Daisy. Uh, let's just kind of like is our session very much. Would you like to right now? P3 37:11 Oh wait, sorry. Did you say something like? Are you asking me a question? Kadir 37:14 I'm just saying, are we? Are we able to right now end the conversation the interview? P3 37:20Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good. Kadir 37:29 Bye, bye. P3 37:30 Goodbye. Shristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P4_Interview March 25, 2024 Shristi 0:06 OK, it's the recording has started. So I'll just first start with a few warm-up questions. Let's just get comfortable around each other . So for that, can you tell me a little bit about yourself first? P4 0:22 Yeah! My name is Jacob. I'm a sophomore at Iowa State. I'm studying math education. I like music. I'm in the marching band here, and I like to play basketball for fun. Shristi 0:35 Ohh it's great. Thank you so much. So Jacob, what social media platforms do you use? P4 0:47 I would say pretty regularly I use Snapchat and Instagram and then on occasion I use TikTok. Shristi 0:54 OK. Do you remember when you started using Snapchat? P4 1:02 Probably sometime in middle school, so that would probably be about six or seven years ago. Shristi 1:09 OK, so since you are even a frequent user right now, so can you tell me what do you do most on Snapchat? P4 1:17 I send pictures to friends or like it's pretty easy to message a friend and I I do really like the feature of making group chats on Snapchat and that's pretty convenient for like a group project and stuff like that. Shristi 1:29OK, so do you also collaborate with your , I don`t know , colleagues like friends from task to do projects as well? P4 1:38 Yes. Shristi 1:40 OK. I had never heard of that before. Just making sure I got it right. So have you ever used the Snapchat MyAI feature before taking part in this study? P4 1:57 Yes, I have. It was mainly just the kind of like test to see what it could do, like I didn't do like anything like as intricate as the study required, But I have like messed with it a little bit before. Shristi 2:07 Umm, OK. So do you remember when you first played with it or tried it using it? P4 2:14 Yeah, I kind of did similar stuff like like I would do to ChatGPT which is like I was seeing how you could like test it with prompts like for example one time I asked a question and I said like only responding emojis is to see how he would try to do that. It's like just stuff like play with it. Nothing like super in depth. Shristi 2:34 So moving on, so can you tell me or show me an example of how you used Snapchat MyAI? you can talk about something that you did as a part of this study or something outside of it. P4 2:50 Something I did for this study was to get travel recommendations for like a three-day trip and I like one of the things I could do to, like, narrow down the prompt. Once I initially asked was like give my location and like give a pricing. If I thought like a hotel was too expensive, I kind of asked like are there any cheaper options and it referred me to the cheaper options. And what I liked about it was it showed you like like a, you know , like the like, the global Snapchat stories people can upload it and showed you that of that hotel. So you could see like actually what the inside of the hotel looked like and what was going on at the time. Shristi 3:20 Uh-huh. So you could see what other people snapped about the place?P4 3:32 Yes, like if it gave you location, there was like a little circle, you could click on.I think it took a screenshot of it and sent it and it would open like the like the public stories people would post. So you could see like them like showing Snapchat stories like at that hotel or in the area. So if there's like a festival or event going on, you could like see what's actually happening. Shristi 3:53 Oh, that's cool. I didn't know about that, actually . That's great. Shristi 3:56 So the travel recommendation thing that you did, would it be similar to things that you would generally do on MyAI? P4 4:12 Ohh like are you saying? Like what? I actually like to use it for travel travel recommendations like in my own time. Shristi 4:17 So is it do you think that certain example depicts what you usually do on MyAI? P4 4:26 I would say prior to the study , no, just because I didn't really know how useful it would be, but like looking back now, I would like going on in the future. But I would say previously I would not have thought about doing that. Shristi 4:35 OK, so based on any interaction that you did as a part of the study or maybe something outside of it, have you ever found MyAI to be useful? P4 4:51 Prior to the study , I would say no, I didn't use it in depth like say just Googling something or ChatGPT , so I didn't really know the capabilities before the study . Shristi 5:05 Makes sense! So after the study , do you think there might be use cases for you for MyAI in the coming future? P4 5:15 Yeah, like I really did like the convenience of it. And I do like cooking and I think I mentioned that it would be pretty easy to ask like, how do I substitute this for recipe or like pretty easy to live ask it a specific question without having to Google and filter through results.Shristi 5:33 Can you share an experience where you felt MyAI meet your expectations? P4 5:52 I would say just like with the trivia game, it did. It was pretty straightforward. It was just like I asked it to, like, give me a I think it was Star Wars trivia and it like gave an answer or get, gave a question with four different answers in multiple choice. It was pretty straightforward. Shristi 6:08 So when you say straightforward, what do you like about the interaction that happened during the game? P4 6:20 Umm, when you gave an answer , if it was wrong, it would like explain why it gave context instead of like just like instantly giving you like what was right what was wrong. I liked how it kind of explained, and at once there was one point that was kind of confusing, and I asked it to explain, and it did explain like quite a bit more than just like otherwise I'd have to like Google it and like figure it on my own. But I did like how it it explained it pretty well. Shristi 6:45 Can you share an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations? P4 6:56 I would say umm. I asked it for like the three-day trip that was a prompt. I asked it for travel directions and like I I gave where I was like I said, Ames, IA and it couldn't give like directions. it said it for some reason it didn't have my location, which I was kind of confused because I thought like, you know , Snapchat gonna has your location. So you would have to use an external app and like it recommended apps to use, but it couldn't itself give you directions. Shristi 7:29 Yeah, I saw that interaction in one of your screen captures. So when you said you thought Snapchat usually has your location, so because there is a setting where you can turn it on or off. So for yours, have you turned on the location setting for Snapchat? P4 7:49 Yes, because like that I know . Like there's like that Snapmap feature in mine is on. Shristi 7:54OK. Thank you for clearing that up. So when you were using MyAI for the four days during the study , or even beyond that in general, how much effort do you think was required to use MyAI? P4 8:13 Uh, not much. Because like most of the stuff was like pretty general, I think sometimes you kind of had to narrow it down to like if you wanted like a more specific response. But that's like really on you if you want, like like a specific category like like I was saying with like a hotel, like a cheaper hotel. You kinda have to specify that, but I would say overall you don't have to like put that much effort into it. Shristi 8:34 So when you say it was not much effort, why do you think it was not a lot of effort, even if you had to narrow down what you were asking a lot of times or maybe switch up what questions you were asking, why do you think it was not a lot of effort? P4 8:55 Because like where it differs versus like Google is like holds on like what you were just talking about. And I think like the context of what you're previous prompt was, it holds that over . So I don't have to like restate something. Like it'll kind of like think like of like about base and what you already said like how to narrow down more. So I think with the how I use this context as why it's easier than like a Googling something. Shristi 9:20 Yeah, that that makes it helpful for me to understand. So do you think that anybody you needed any special skills for using MyAI well? P4 9:37 There might be some skill into like getting a very specific prompt, but overall is pretty intuitive and like I think you could even like ask it for help on how to use it effectively and probably answer that well, but overall I did not. I'm not super like tech knowledgeable and I didn't have any difficulty with it. Shristi 9:56 So when you are using MyAI, did you face any obstacles that you encountered? P4 10:13 It's not a big obstacle, but there is the whole location thing and it couldn't give me directions. And I think one time during the trivia game, it did actually like mess up which answer was correct? But that was it. And I wanna say, those weren't really obstaclesbecause like it didn't really like ruin the experience at all. So overall, I wouldn't say there weren't really , really many obstacles at all. Shristi 10:36 Umm, so when you found that MyAI got confused with the trivia question, do you remember how you attempted to resolve the problem? P4 11:02 Yeah, I believe I responded and said I was pretty sure it should be like this other answer , and then like, I think my response with ohh like yeah like upon like looking into it more like yeah that's correct. Like I apologize for my mistake and it kind of like corrected itself. Shristi 11:17 So I do remember there was that this interaction was quite interesting for me when when you remember when I think it was the third day activity where you had to like stand stickers and pictures and you had sent the dragon one and and you kept telling the AI this is this character from Mario. Don't you, like, recognize this? P4 11:38 Yeah, yeah. Shristi 11:39 And then you send a picture like the sticker again and it it does not recognize at all. P4 11:44 Yes, yeah. Shristi 11:46 Did you feel any, you know , discomfort or problem when the interactions were going in that direction at the time? P4 11:56 OK, I'm glad you got that. You brought that up because I totally forgot about that. But yeah, like I was impressed with how like it recognizes like a photo very well. Like if you send like a selfie like it'll be like, oh, like I see it's night or like it can tell, like, very well, it's going on in the background. But the stickers, like it was just a picture. Yeah, Bowser from Mario and like at first, it didn't recognize it. And I said Ohh, it's Bowser and it's like, uh, like, yeah, I know what that is. And like like you were saying, I kept resending it just like did not recognize that no matter how many times I sent it. So I don't know . I wouldn't say it was discomfort, but I just kind of like I was surprised that it's able to pick up like a photo background so well, but it can't pick up the sticker very well at all.Shristi 12:33 Yeah, I think maybe because it's asserting character . Maybe. Yeah, that's something interesting to look into, for sure. So when you were using MyAI, did you feel like you had access to necessary resources or support to use MyAI properly? P4 12:57 Yeah, I think so. I think it's pretty like, well contained. We're like it can answer your own questions very well. I did like how like on certain prompts it would give you like good follow-up questions. You could just click on and it would ask it for you and answer right away and like on the occasional time like with the directions it would refer you to like a better application that you could use. So I would say overall it's pretty useful and like even if it doesn't have like the right resource, it can like refer you pretty well. Shristi 13:19 OK, so when so I think for the study we did tell you about it and we asked you to use it, but apart from us, have you have you heard somebody else talk about MyAI, it could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet? P4 13:51 Just when you was very new, like when it was first coming out, people were talking about it and like using an A lot and like seeing what they could do with it. But that's really the only time I've heard of like people I know using it. Shristi 14:04 So had there been anybody who encouraged you to, you know , like use the tool? It might be someone who said something to you personally , or maybe you saw people talking about it on the Internet, telling people who use MyAI. P4 14:25 I hadn't heard my friends like about this, but I I think I saw somewhere online that like after like the photo feature was like kind of unable to was cool like to see like how it responded like certain pictures like I saw that and I was interested so like I would send it like random pictures of like maybe like a forest near me in different stuff like I would see what it would say to that and it's pretty interesting to see how like how well it was at like describing the photo you would send. Shristi 14:51 So when you first tried MyAI, when it first came out, did you try it? You know , because I think Snapchat sent push notifications and like a message to everybody about, hey, this is a new feature we have. So did you try it because of that? Or maybe because you saw other people doing it.P4 15:15 I never remember getting a push notification, but I do remember like other people using it to like that made me wanna try it out. So I'd say, yeah, from other people. Shristi 15:24 So after using it, you know for a few days based on what you've interacted with, would you recommend other people to try using MyAI? P4 15:41 Yeah, I think I would. I think this study definitely made me realize, like how actually like, useful and versatile it can be. And I think for like like the different prompts you gave or are good examples. And like, it's funny , like even like the other day, I kind of asked, like, where's like a good restaurant to eat like, that was independent from the study and actually give me a a good, a good response and actually went to that restaurant. I recommend. It was really good. Shristi 16:04 So in addition to looking for restaurants, have you, you know , found yourself using MyAI apart from our study? P4 16:17 Uh, not yet, but I'm sure in the future I will. Shristi 16:20 OK so after using MyAI, have you noticed any changes in your social media habits? P4 16:33 I'm not sure 'cause I like I said it hasn't been that long since the study . So I would say like, not too. I haven't noticed a big difference, I would say. Shristi 16:44 OK, makes sense. So do you think you have used in the past or are currently using something that is similar to MyAI? P4 16:58 Yes, I have used ChatGPT before. Shristi 17:01 OK, so when you are using a chat GPT versus when you are using MyAI, do you feel there are any similarities between the two tools?P4 17:16 I think definitely like in responses. I do notice like the structure of responses are pretty similar and you can kind of like tell ohh this is likely AI generated and like I think like you know it's very similar to like how you like input a prompt in that response. So I'd say they're pretty similar in that aspect. Shristi 17:36 And going further from the similarity is, do you recognize any story differences between the two applications? P4 17:49 I think definitely like the Snapchat one was distinct in like the Snapmap feature. And like how it how it utilizes like Snapchat's own features. Or you can like send in a photo and stuff like that whereas it's like ChatGPT is pretty separate and it's like just like the text aspect of it. So let's say that's a big difference. Shristi 18:09 While you were interacting with MyAI, did you see any ads or sponsored content? P4 18:22 Yes, I did. It was strange because the first day I did not, but then the second day was like. It seemed like every prompt had one. It's just like, you know , like link you to Amazon and sometimes it was useful because, like, I think I like, like asked it about. I don't remember what the the prompt was like. Oh, like, where can I buy this near me? And it links me to an Amazon. And that was kind of useful, but otherwise it just seemed like every prompt had an ad that it didn't need. Shristi 18:48 So the sponsored ads that you were getting were not relevant to what you were asking at all? P4 19:01 I don't remember because like at a point I just kind of like ignored them because I just scrolled past. But like I remember thinking like, ohh, why is this? Why is there an ad for this like I was just asking a simple question, so I think there were times. Shristi 19:14 So umm, so you know when you saw so many ads popping up, how did it make you feel at the time?P4 19:28 Why I think at first I was surprised because I never knew that they had like sponsored ads in there. And then when it started, like becoming when it started to get to the point where, like every response and it was just, it just seemed like that one day it happened. I was like kind of frustrated, like, I'm like, why is there? Why is there an ad on every response here? Shristi 19:47 So during the interaction that we saw, we did find a few examples where you thought that the the response that you got were not accurate from MyAI. So having that pretext, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI? P4 20:15 I would say like Gene, generally like AI's or my eyes, like pretty good for like general stuff. I don't know if I would use it for something like statistics or like like more more recent information like I'd rather like Google that. But if it's like if it's like a like, it gave me a recipe for something like, I would trust that cause. It's just like a it's a recipe like I wouldn't ask anything like controversial, but if it's like a known thing that we've known for a long time, I would trust it there. Shristi 20:43 So when you say you would trust MyAI for non serious/personal stuff, So what kind of use cases do you think MyAI would help you in your daily life? P4 21:02 Like maybe stores near me. Like what those stores sell? Restaurants near me that are good, certain recipes that like stuff with food I think it would be good like earlier I was time of like if you maybe like if you're making a recipe and like you might not have a certain ingredient, I think MyAI would be good to say ohh like what's a good substitute for this or like ohh I messed up this part of my recipe. Like how can I fix my cooking from here because that's like a more specific thing that like maybe Googling can't help with. Shristi 21:33 Do you also feel comfortable using MyAI for something that's relevant to your academic tasks? Maybe learning something new or or even using it for something relevant in your assignments or maybe classes? Do you feel comfortable doing that? P4 21:53 I don't think it would be just cause like I don't know . I'd rather like either ask a professor or like, you know , find a different like more reliable source. I'm not sure because I don't know I wouldn't wanna like put that as like a source or, you know , I'd rather like do it independently , I feel like. Shristi 22:10 So when you were interacting it with stickers and pictures and even with your prompts,you might have shared something personal while interactive with MyAI. So what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by the company? P4 22:35 I would say I'm actually like not super concerned because like I've never sent something over Snapchat that like I've been worried about getting out because I know like there's like a whole thing with like digital footprint. Like I I don't know like how they like translate the photo or like what they do with it, but like I just like make sure that I'm safe with it. So like if if what I put in is safe then like I know I'm not worried about it getting out. Shristi 23:01 I think when we talked, I think we did not really talk much about the shopping task that we had, so do you remember how that shopping task went? If you remember , can you kind of walk us through what you did with it? P4 23:23 Yeah, I think I just kind of like a niche like asked the broad question like hey, like what kind of stores are nearby me and like it told me at Walmart and Target and some other stories. And then from there I narrowed it down and said ohh like what does target sell? Like what does Walmart sell? Like can I buy this certain product at this store? Just like I started with like a broad term and then narrow it down, I would say the only issue with that was this was kind of like an off-side thing, but there's like a convenience store at Iowa State. And I asked it about that when they get it kind of got confused with like, a farmer's market at some point. But that was that was the only thing. Shristi 23:57 I do remember seeing that screenshot I think is that this little convenience store that's inside the. So is it the convenience store that's inside one of the apartments in in? P4 24:21 No, I know you're talking about, but Union Drive Community Center . Shristi 24:27 So yeah, when you were talking with it about the convenience store, I think I think it give you like several recommendations of things you can find. I think by that time you realize that it was not talking about the convenience store and something else. And then you said, hey, it's not. I'm talking about this. So what products do you think can be found here? And I think the response MyAI gave was like pretty generic of what things you could find in any convenience store. It was like, hey, yeah, you can find sodas and snacks and stuff like that. So in in that interaction, how did you feel about the usefulness of the information in terms of the specific question that you had asked? P4 25:23 I would say I kind of realized that it wasn't super usefull for something that's specific likethis certain small store. It's like not a good option for and I felt like I'd rather Google it or ask around at that point, whereas like something more broad like a big place like Walmart that you have like a lot of that's a good thing to ask MyAI for, but like a smaller store that might only have like one or a couple locations might not be as a that's good to ask about using MyAI. Shristi 25:54 So building a little bit upon the similarities and differences we talked about with ChatGPT , I think you've noticed that the way you talk with MyAI is a little bit different from what you would talk or or you know , like converse or communicate with ChatGPT . Because of the nature of what MyAI is represented as, does your interaction differ from what you would do with ChatGPT? Is there something different? How you pose the questions. P4 26:38 I would think first I'll just like I would never like I was saying like use MyAI for academics. Since like I'm a MATH major , I might use ChatGPT if I'm confused on a concept I might use ChatGPT , like explain a some kind of concept to me in like a certain way that that way I could understand it better , whereas MyAI might be better for like we're saying like the cooking or travel recommendations. But I would like a prompt I would trust like ChadGPT more with like academic stuff, but I wouldn't rely on it fully of course. Shristi 27:15 Summing up, so summing up the entire interview . You've already talked about things that MyAI is good for, and I think you've already touched into it. But what cases do you think MyAI is not useful for at all? P4 27:43 Kind of like when I said it earlier , like anything super recent, anything that like people have a different opinion on like, controversial. I wanna use it for anything that's like like a statistic or fact. Or like ohh like can you like get a quote from this book for me? I'd rather like do that myself or like something academic. I don't think I would use MyAI for any of those things. Shristi 28:06 So yeah, that's all the questions that we had. Thank you so much for answering it. Yeah, we did it pretty fast. I was not expecting to be done with this early , but yeah, we had a good conversation. So before we end the recording, is there something that you would like to mention that we did not get around talking about? P4 28:30 Uh, I guess it was interesting to see, like, I didn't realize, like the capability of MyAIbefore the study . So it kind of opened me up to like actually seeing like how you can utilize MyAI versus just kind of like messing around with it like I've realized it's actually pretty useful and have some good features. Kadir 28:56 Umm, so Jacob, I have a quick follow-up with one of your answers. You were saying that you would probably be feeling more reliable or you would think MyAI is not as reliable as ChatGPT for maybe serious tasks. I understand probably you are thinking about the responses you're getting from both systems and then maybe you are evaluating that reliability based on the responses. But other than the response quality , is there any other reasons why you think MyAI might seem less reliable than ChatGPT? P4 29:46 I don't even you know that's an interesting point. I can't really give any specifics on that because I've actually , I've never really tested it and like putting like a like a prompt like explain this concept to me before like that might be something to play around with because I wondered like I might just be thinking that cause like you know , I don't think of like Snapchat like the most professional thing. So it could just be like that kind of like setting like ohh, it's like snapchatting a like a friend, quote unquote when you're talking MyAI versus ChatGPR is more separated from that. So it could just be that. I think I might have to look into that more, but I wouldn't say that there's nothing really specific for my reasoning to be honest. Kadir 30:26 OK. Thanks very much.\"]\n",

So.\\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself, if possible?\\n\\nP2   0:25\\nLittle about myself?\\nKadir   0:27\\nYes, yes.\\n\\nP2   0:27\\nOK, so I\\'m a graduate student here, here at the [a US university], and now graduating this year.\\nSo I\\'m doing my civil engineering masters in civil engineering with an emphasis on Geotechnical engineering. I think I have been using Snapchat for the past three years. If you want to know.\\n\\nKadir   0:50\\nWow. Past three years, it\\'s been quite a few kind of like experience probably it seems alright So then could you also tell me what social media platforms do you use other than, let\\'s say, in this case, Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   1:10\\nUh, so Instagram. Facebook, mostly on Instagram and mostly Instagram. Other than that, Facebook, sometimes with Twitter, and that\\'s all. If LinkedIn counts as social media, I did that while I was searching for jobs, but not anymore.\\n\\nKadir   1:28\\nSo we get an Instagram. Facebook OK. Yeah, that\\'s that\\'s fair. So. When when did you start using Snapchat? Uh.\\n\\nP2   1:46\\nSo yeah, it was like back and forth when I when I was back in [a South Asian Country]. So I usually use for like one month and then the not use that for like one year and then again come back.\\nBut after I came to US like it\\'s been like 2 years, most probably. So I\\'ve been like continuously using it for the past two years.I would say.\\n\\nKadir   2:05\\nNo. OK. So just. Is there any umm what makes a continuous use in the US for Snapchat?\\nIs there any kind of like reason for?\\n\\nP2   2:18\\nAnd now, and there\\'s not, not not this kind of disparity while competing with [a South Asian Country] and US, but just that when I am in the US, I could like connect with my friends, move through Snapchat with home in [a South Asian Country] So back back when I was in [a South Asian Country], I didn\\'t didn\\'t need to do that because I was actually there. So that makes it easy to like...\\n\\nKadir   2:36\\nOK, OK. Yeah.\\n\\nP2   2:37\\n..know what they\\'re doing like in their daily life. And like you know about their situations, where it\\'s pretty fun.\\n\\nKadir   2:43\\nYeah, I got it. That makes sense. That makes sense. I relate to that for sure.\\n\\nP2   2:49\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   2:50\\nWhat do you do most on on the on the Snapchat then could you tell us a little bit?\\n\\nP2   2:56\\nYeah. So. So I\\'m like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you\\'re doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it\\'s like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it\\'s kind of like to. So what you\\'re doing on a bit daily basis, so it\\'s kind of fun.\\n\\nKadir   3:28\\nOK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well.\\n\\nP2   3:32\\nYeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   3:45\\nOK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?\\n\\nP2   4:02\\nUh, so when it was first released, I don\\'t know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don\\'t know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was first released, but to be honest, after that I haven\\'t really used this before this program or before your project.\\n\\nKadir   4:10\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:22\\nSo yeah, I don\\'t have very much experience than you guys as well, so.\\n\\nKadir   4:22\\nUmm.\\nYeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was.\\n\\nP2   4:32\\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here.\\n\\nKadir   4:35\\nYeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it?\\n\\nP2   4:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat field whenever you Instagram.\\n\\nKadir   4:44\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   4:45\\nSo it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven\\'t really used it.\\n\\nKadir   4:53\\nOK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature.\\n\\nP2   5:07\\nYeah. Yeah, I did.\\n\\nKadir   5:08\\nUh, yeah.\\n\\nP2   5:08\\nI did.\\n\\nKadir   5:09\\nSo then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn\\'t related to the study.\\n\\nP2   5:21\\nYeah. Yeah, I\\'m gonna. I\\'m going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you first was. What was the first task? If you can remind me.\\n\\nKadir   5:34\\nI think we asked you to have a travel recommendation.\\n\\nP2   5:39\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn\\'t think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days.\\nI have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the first answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary.\\n\\nKadir   5:58\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   6:03\\nIt give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing.\\nSo I..I was kind of like I didn\\'t check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing.\\n\\nKadir   6:20\\nOhh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details.\\n\\nP2   6:27\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   6:27\\nOK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that first task?\\n\\nP2   6:40\\nNo, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So first of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   6:59\\nOK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences.\\n\\nP2   7:16\\nMy prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the \"guess the country\\'s flag\" game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that\\'s all I have.\\n\\nKadir   7:34\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   7:36\\nIt\\'s like kind of. It\\'s not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it\\'s it\\'s kind of cool.\\n\\nKadir   7:47\\nYeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don\\'t know, like kill time at the time and then.\\n\\nP2   7:53\\nYou\\'re saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it.\\n\\nKadir   8:08\\nMm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience?\\n\\nP2   8:31\\nOK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I\\'m working on my thesis or something like that. So it\\'s really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that\\'s why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I\\'ve used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two.\\n\\nKadir   9:01\\nHmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations?\\n\\nP2   9:17\\nWith my expectations, OK, so.\\n\\nKadir   9:20\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   9:24\\nUmm. Let\\'s see. I\\'m gonna. I\\'m going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker.\\n\\nKadir   9:37\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   9:39\\nIt didn\\'t perform that well on this one. So I think the first the first tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me first suggestion on soccer cleats but didn\\'t like it, didn\\'t like provide like such great information on that.\\nAnd also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn\\'t recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period.\\nIt\\'s going like provide much information about there.\\nSo I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one.\\n\\nKadir   10:41\\nThe first one.\\n\\nP2   10:42\\nYeah. The first one was the. Yeah, it was the best one.\\n\\nKadir   10:46\\nThe the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it.\\n\\nP2   10:52\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.\\n\\nKadir   10:54\\nYeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember.\\n\\nP2   11:03\\nI..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nKadir   11:10\\nRocky mountains.\\n\\nP2   11:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:14\\nSo do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean?\\n\\nP2   11:20\\nThat\\'s where I would go. Yeah, absolutely.\\nI gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life.\\n\\nKadir   11:23\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   11:29\\nSo and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that\\'s a place where I would definitely go in the future, so.\\n\\nKadir   11:36\\nMaybe that\\'s why you it could be aligning. OK, OK.\\n\\nP2   11:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   11:40\\nI totally understand. Yeah. So then also, yeah. Can you share an experience where it didn\\'t meet your expectations? And then yeah, that would be nice.\\n\\nP2   11:50\\nNo. OK, OK. So let me go over the task with the shopping list, right? The..where you wanted to do like buy something.\\n\\nKadir   11:59\\nYes.\\n\\nP2   12:05\\nI really needed a new..\\n\\nKadir   12:06\\nYou wanted to buy, right?\\n\\nP2   12:08\\nYeah, I I needed a new soccer cleats right now, so I just try to like incorporate that in the task as well. So I asked him to like, suggest me some soccer cleats based on my position of play like soccer field. So I play midfielders generally, so I wanted something light and something that lasted me long because last soccer cleat that I bought was like only for three or four months.\\nIt suggested me like 2..2 of the like most famous soccer cleats, which were like all over the Internet as so. Yeah. And I asked like, it is a well out of my budget. So can you like say say something in between like 150 to $200.00 but it still gave me the same same two models that it showed me like previously and after that what I did was I asked for like the pictures.\\nLike the pictures, if if you provide like pictures from the Internet but no it it couldn\\'t provide that\\nSo I think that was the worst experience with me. So it\\'s sort of like a prompt insert a picture of [inaudible] within like big brackets. You can see in the screenshots so it was kind of like not that good.\\n\\nKadir   13:14\\nYeah. What was lacking in in that?\\n\\nP2   13:17\\nYeah. So I I I asked the picture of like 2 soccer cleats that it was trying to show me earlier and it couldn\\'t like provide me the picture and also the it couldn\\'t like uh what do you say..suggest the price..uh..the cleats within my budget so. It it only knew about like 2 soccer cleats and it kind of like repeatedly went on and went on about the same thing again and again even if you asked like different questions.\\n\\nKadir   13:46\\nUmm, so it was not.. OK. Yeah, I I I got it. Definitely. So, uh, how much effort was required to use MyAI chatbot in your experiences so far?\\n\\nP2   14:05\\nI guess it depends on like what kind of question you\\'re asking. So again, so the first task that I did was like pretty smooth and I got what was required within like 3 or 4 questions or prompts.\\nBut for the..as I have said like..\\n\\nKadir   14:17\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP2   14:21\\nThe soccer cleats one.. the shopping list and also the describe the picture or something like that. So it took like will more than like ten tries to get even get like close to it. So it was like stuck on one thing and it\\'s going to go like up from that. So even if I ask a lot of questions, so yeah, I think it depends on my experience. It depends on what you\\'re actually trying to ask out of the MyAI feature.\\n\\nKadir   14:46\\nOK. So then as far as I understand, do you mean, I mean it depends on the topic. It depends on.\\n\\nP2   14:53\\nYeah, yeah. It depends on the topic and how well known the topic is. I most probably because National parks are like more searched than football cleats..I guess..all over the Internet and yeah, I did ask it about like this dish from [a South Asian Country] during my photo.. Task with the photo uploading a picture and then asking about the picture.\\n\\nSo it couldn\\'t recognize that, and even if I like told it that it was like a dish from [a South Asian Country]. So it could not provide much information about that as well. So I think it depends on how what would people like asking the in the Internet more. So if you like talk about a least talked topic with the MyAI think it just like other time to like actually go into the topic you like you\\'ll be stuck somewhere around like in the first two or three replies and then if you like try to get more out of it..it will take some time on those kind of topics.\\n\\nKadir   15:28\\nOK. Umm. I I get it. Yeah. When it start then it\\'s it\\'s not maybe forwarding with the conversation, unfortunately.\\n\\nP2   16:01\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:02\\nOK. So, uh, uh, do you think any skills are needed? Uh, any any skills are needed to use MyAI chatbot well or effectively let\\'s say.\\n\\nP2   16:19\\nI think even like no basic English writing and reading then it would be enough. You doing anything so that you just need to know about the Snapchat interface interface and just the basic English that you do writing, typing, reading. So I think that that that\\'s enough.So I don\\'t think that\\'s like too much.\\n\\nKadir   16:37\\nUmm, so basically kind of English proficiency and then kind of writing, typing and you said writing typing.\\n\\nP2   16:43\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   16:45\\nI mean, do you think? By writing, is there any? Specific skills for.\\n\\nP2   16:55\\nAnd not have I just writing because like the way the AI AI reacts to your message like it largely or it mostly depends on your prompt right.\\nIf you like, try to get trying to get some information out of the MyAI but you are not like expressing yourself well in the prompt. So then it will like take wrong turn on like it will not understand what you\\'d like to say. So if you have like good understanding of English writing and reading and then a good understanding of Snapchat because you have to first of all go to MyAI to like type type it out. So if you have a good knowledge of that interface, then I think anyone can do this.\\n\\nKadir   17:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   17:32\\nAnyone, anyone can utilize this yeah.\\n\\nKadir   17:33\\nOK. OK. So just here I have one more follow up. So then do you think in terms of writing or typing? Different writing and prompting would would would differ. Do you think I mean how is your experience with that?\\n\\nP2   17:59\\nI think so. Yeah, I think like the way you write or like the way you present a prompt to an to MyAI. So it will definitely like the answer would be definitely different, so I don\\'t know how to fix it, but yeah, if you like, try a write a prompt in it like a detailed manner.\\n\\nKadir   18:09\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   18:15\\nSo you should like express all the things that you need to get out of my head. Sometimes it might work, but sometimes it can\\'t, like necessarily pushes all the information. I think like that.\\nSo that\\'s why I always like start with the small short short, short prompt and then try to go into deep into the conversation after it kind of like replies in a good way or replies in a good direction.\\n\\nKadir   18:32\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   18:37\\nSo if yeah.\\n\\nKadir   18:39\\nOK.\\nUmm.\\nAnd in your experiences during the diary study or prior, did you encounter any obstacles when using MyAI.\\n\\nP2   18:56\\nObstacles. And does advertisements count as obstacle? Because I received like a lot of that.\\n\\nKadir   19:03\\nHmm so.\\n\\nP2   19:05\\nYeah, they were like a lot of extra, but it\\'s advertisements which are not related to my prompts or anything like that. So this has been like annoying. Other than that, I don\\'t think so. I like a little bit of trouble uploading a picture. I don\\'t know why it like took a lot of long time. It took like about one minute to upload a picture, so I think those two are the major things that I did not like or would say obstacles while doing your the diary stories.\\n\\nKadir   19:27\\nMm-hmm. So what makes advertisements? Kind of like annoying for you. Or think you are that they are, they might be obstacle.\\n\\nP2   19:44\\nSo if if the advertisement are like what I\\'m looking for. So if I\\'m like if they are like what, how do I put it? So if I see a random advertisement on my screen, so it must be like something related to what I\\'m trying to say, right to MyAI.\\n\\nKadir   19:58\\nHearing me.\\n\\nP2   19:59\\nBut it is like some random kind of thing, like some magazine covers or something like that.\\nSo which I haven\\'t really talked about it with MyAI then I think that it\\'s like kind of annoying.\\n\\nKadir   20:11\\nOK, OK. Yeah, yeah, definitely. If if it\\'s not related to your purpose, I understand.\\n\\nP2   20:16\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir   20:16\\nYep. Uh. So. Do you like? Do you feel like you have access to necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP2   20:29\\nYeah, I think so.\\n\\nKadir   20:31\\nOK. So that\\'s that\\'s fair enough. And have you heard somebody in your circle or environment else talk about MyAI before?\\n\\nP2   20:49\\nWhen, it like first came out. Yes, but after that I don\\'t think like anybody is using it would even though people using Snapchat. So when it first came out, like we were like, kind of, what do you say we were like, trying to see what that was? So it was introduced as your personal assistant on Snapchat first. So before MyAI, I think so it it was introduced as personal assistant.\\nSo I had like few talks with it and also some of my friends did as well. So yeah, but I don\\'t think it\\'s like that, that that used right now.\\n\\nKadir   21:18\\nAnd. OK so.\\n\\nP2   21:22\\nI can\\'t speak for all of all of us, but that\\'s what I think.\\n\\nKadir   21:27\\nOK, so it can be a friend. It can be an acquaintance or a media, so probably you\\'ve heard from friends when it came up first. As far as I understand.\\n\\nP2   21:36\\nYeah. Yeah, it\\'s gonna be your friend as well. So as I told you earlier, so when I was stuck once in the airport so I had nothing to do with having to talk with an AI. So yeah, it it did help me at that time. So it can be your friend.\\n\\nKadir   21:48\\nOK. OK.\\n\\nP2   21:49\\nYou\\'re gonna situation, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   21:51\\nYeah. So then yeah, it\\'s more like if you if you, I mean you said for example you might be considering it as a friend or maybe personal assistant. So does this affect anything or how does it, you know affect you communication with with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   22:17\\nSo if you\\'re like trying to like, uh, if you think of it as a friend, I think, and your prompt are what you type into the my hair would be like a lot of a lot friendly. So I think that\\'s the only thing.\\nSo what? What you consider it as if you like. Think of it like a search engine. Or like, uh, yeah, feature that will help you to get some information. So you are prompt would would would be formal and you would like have to like type it in a detail. But if you like using it for fun so it can be like short and like silly kind of prompts because you that depends on the intent of use right?\\n\\nKadir   22:51\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   22:53\\nSo I think there\\'s there\\'s the rest of the difference.\\n\\nKadir   22:57\\nOK. Yeah, so. Have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAI?\\n\\nP2   23:11\\nNo, not exactly MyAI, but like another a lot of other generative AI, so even my professor my advisor tells me to like properly use like ChatGPT or something like that. Other generative AI, but not exactly my Snapchat. Yeah, because I think the demographics are the people using my AI is like kind of like limited to teenagers right now. So they are not the guys who I would take advice with.\\n\\nKadir   23:32\\nUh-huh.\\n\\nP2   23:35\\nSo I think that that.\\n\\nKadir   23:37\\nWell, OK, OK, I got it.\\n\\nP2   23:38\\nWe could.\\n\\nKadir   23:41\\nSo would you recommend trying myAI to your friends?\\n\\nP2   23:49\\nYes, you\\'re I can do that.\\n\\nKadir   23:54\\nAnd why?\\n\\nP2   23:55\\nBut but according to the user\\'s there, according to the uses, if they want to like search for anything specific then I wouldn\\'t like tell them to go to go and search in MyAI because I don\\'t think like it\\'s like that effective.\\n\\nKadir   23:55\\nWhy would you?\\nWhy would you?\\n\\nP2   24:09\\nBut if they just want to have fun, I can like this. Suggest them this. Speak with MyAI in the future. It was one like I can say like that, but if they want like get some information out of MyAI, then I would not recommend it.\\n\\nKadir   24:22\\nOK, OK. And since starting using my I have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\\n\\nP2   24:34\\nNo, no, I I have noticed with I think it is just the same.\\n\\nKadir   24:35\\nGeneral social media habits, I mean. OK. Uh, do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to MyAI?\\n\\nP2   24:52\\nMy uh, yeah, I use like ChatGPT on a daily basis.\\n\\nKadir   24:57\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   24:57\\nAll the other than that, I don\\'t think I have like much explicit experience with other generative AI apps or some like that. I think that ChatGPT is the only one.\\n\\nKadir   25:07\\nOK. Yeah. I asked this but still I wanna ask. Maybe a kind of follow up. What is similar between chat GPT and MyAI or? And what is different in essence?\\n\\nP2   25:25\\nOK. So in essence, OK, so the I think what I feel is like ChatGPT, if you like ask any questions.\\nSo it will like generally it will respond in like formal matters like and I use it like more more for like formal things. So if I have to write to mail and I want to like make like make it like good I ask such as visual change the mail and change the mail to a better format. And if I\\'m writing a document and I think that my English is a little bit bad, then I asked the charge to change it into kind of like formal or like more scientific terms or write in a better way or for clarity or something like that. So I think it\\'s like more more used in like office kind of work with ChatGPT.\\nUh, for me personally, so actually use this during my thesis.. so during my thesis.\\n\\nI use this use this a lot but MyAI I think it\\'s just like as I said earlier. So I we can use it as a friend.\\nSo if I you don\\'t need to be like that formal it doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t become that formal with you in the responses, so it\\'s like kind of like friendly chat I felt. So yeah, I think the main difference between that is like my uses, it depends on my users as well.\\n\\nKadir   26:33\\nHmm.\\n\\nP2   26:39\\nSo I use my.\\n\\nKadir   26:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   26:41\\nI use ChatGPT for like a lot of things in my work, but yeah, MyAI not that much.\\n\\nKadir   26:45\\nHmm.\\nUmm uh, yeah, I think this is this is pretty helpful. So I remember you also were telling about you use ChatGPT on your desktop and then MyAI on your phone so.\\n\\nP2   27:01\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir   27:05\\nOther than kind of like categorizing you said ChatGPT, for more formal stuff for more. Maybe professional stuff versus check MyAI, more personal, maybe more lightweight.\\n\\nP2   27:16\\nYes. Yeah.\\n\\nKadir   27:17\\nSo what characteristics? What characteristics of MyAI leads to that kind of like perception or perspective for you?\\n\\nP2   27:32\\nUh, so yeah, if you like, look at some of the things, some of the screenshots. So the way that MyAI reply is, so it\\'s like pretty like informal, if you see uses like worse like oops, my bad something like that.\\n\\nKadir   27:42\\nUh.\\n\\nP2   27:46\\nSo the things that you use and in like daily conversation with the friends and all so and it it is like kind of like what do you say expressive of its emotion? I think so because like it it kind of like if I tell it that it is wrong, then it says like, oops, I\\'m..I\\'m so sorry for that. Something like that.\\n\\nKadir   28:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   28:04\\nWe don\\'t see in terms if you did that often, so eventually like give a prompt, then it will just say something formally. So I think this is the main reason why is why I said so.\\n\\nKadir   28:14\\nMore conversational features of language. Uh.\\n\\nP2   28:18\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir   28:19\\nSupposed in my AI any have you? I don\\'t know. Like would you like to eligible bit comment on any. Like interface features like any features that MyAI has, make it more personal or versus impersonal.\\n\\nP2   28:39\\nInterface features. Uh, I think it\\'s just like chatting with a friend right in MyAI. So if you if you have seen the interface of my AI so it\\'s like exactly the same as like other Snapchat chats.\\n\\nKadir   28:47\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   28:56\\nAnd so it has like a place to, like, upload your pictures or something like that. Send a sticker, sticker or even like voice memos, which you don\\'t see in ChatGPT.\\n\\nKadir   29:03\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   29:04\\nSo yeah, I think that all the interface is is it is like making it is like designed to be like your personal friend or assistant like that\\'s what I feel.\\n\\nKadir   29:15\\nOK. OK, definitely indefinitely. That makes sense. So I think you said this, you saw some ads or sponsored content while interacting with MyAI.\\n\\nP2   29:30\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nKadir   29:30\\nAnd then you\\'re feeling was OK. I\\'m skipping this question because you already kind of responded to that, sorry. So in terms of in your conversation with my I, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\\n\\nP2   29:51\\nReliable.\\n\\nKadir   29:52\\nYeah. Do you think the responses from my AI have reliable they are.\\n\\nP2   29:57\\nSo far I don\\'t think I can see that I can answer this question right now because I haven\\'t like cross checked, but it uh answered me because I actually to like give me an itinerary with all the pricing and the budgeting. But I haven\\'t like looked into how accurate that was really. But I know from the fact that it gave me like wrong information on the soccer fields, so I would say not that reliable.\\n\\nKadir   30:21\\nHmm. Yeah. With soccer cleats I? When I looked at your screenshots, umm for all the options it was offering giving the same price right?\\n\\nP2   30:33\\nYeah, I I told it like it. My budget is like $150.00 and give me a price range for all of the soccer cleats, but I think it it all showed the same pricing like $150.00 for everything yeah.\\n\\nKadir   30:47\\nAnd then it\\'s kind of like a question mark, I I see, like I, yeah, so you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI, for example, I\\'ve seen a you you share your picture with the chat, but what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by MyAI on Snapchat or by Snapchat let\\'s say?\\n\\nP2   30:49\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, I I couldn\\'t get the last part like that. Good. Can you like repeat that again?\\n\\nKadir   31:20\\nSure you shared. Let me quickly be we\\'re waiting. You might have shared something personal when interacting with the my AI chat bot and what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by Snapchat.\\n\\nP2   31:38\\nUsed by Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir   31:40\\nYeah.\\n\\nP2   31:42\\nI don\\'t think I have, like, ever thought of thought it. So what I think what do you want me to say in that regard? If my information or like pictures are used by the Snapchat itself, the Snapchat app or like my AI in a different way, is like going to be what you say public on the Internet or something like that. I couldn\\'t get the question completely so.\\n\\nKadir   32:08\\nUmm.\\n\\nP2   32:41\\nOK, it\\'s alright. Yeah, I\\'m not that concerned because all everything like you say right now or in the modern day world like they know it all, I think so they can like hear us like through our phones. And so if you look at the ads given by Facebook is like kind of even if I speak in [home country language] with my friend, it kind of latches onto that and shows me the air of the same thing in Facebook.\\n\\nKadir   33:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP2   33:11\\nSo I think our data is being like sold everywhere right now. So I I don\\'t mind. I don\\'t mind it.\\nI..I\\'m not that concerned about it.\\n\\nKadir   33:26\\nOK, I think I this is totally fair. I think this kind of brings us to the end of our conversation. Do you have anything at the very end to add or to emphasize before we hung up?\\n\\nP2   33:44\\nNo, not really. \\n\\nP2   35:08\\nNice to meet you, buddy.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nYeah.\\n\\nShristi   35:11\\nOK, I\\'ll stop the recording.\\n\\nKadir   35:11\\nNice to meet you too.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\\n', \"Transcript P3_Interview\\nMarch 21, 2024\\n\\nShristi started transcription\\n\\nKadir  0:12\\nOK, perfect.\\nSo let's start then.\\nThe recording has started.\\nCan you tell me a little bit about yourself?\\n\\nP3   0:26\\nYeah.\\nSo my my full name is [P3].\\nI'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally.\\n\\nKadir  0:46\\nOK.\\nOK, senior in microbiology and genetics.\\n\\nP3   0:49\\nYes.\\n\\nKadir  0:50\\nOK and.\\nWhat social media platforms do you use?\\n\\nP3   0:58\\nOhm.\\nMore often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  1:06\\nIt's not OK.\\nAnd when did you start using Snapchat?\\n\\nP3   1:18\\nOoh, I wanna say.\\n8-8 years ago or maybe 9?\\n\\nKadir  1:27\\nEight or nine years ago.\\n\\nP3   1:28\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  1:28\\nOK.\\nOK, that's good to know.\\nUmm.\\nAnd then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general?\\n\\nP3   1:40\\nOhm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat.\\n\\nKadir  1:51\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   1:51\\nSo yeah, just chatting with friends.\\n\\nKadir  1:55\\nFriends.\\nOK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them.\\n\\nP3   1:59\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:01\\nOK.\\nOK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes.\\nGot it.\\n\\nP3   2:09\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  2:09\\nSo and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature?\\n\\nP3   2:21\\nUmm.\\nI wanna say, well, when did it do?\\nYou know when it began.\\n\\nKadir  2:29\\nI.\\n\\nShristi   2:30\\nI think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   2:32\\nA year ago.\\nOK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  2:38\\nUmm, when it first launched you either did it and then did.\\n\\nP3   2:40\\nUmm.\\n\\nKadir  2:43\\nDid you use?\\nSince then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time.\\n\\nP3   2:52\\nI used it when it first came out and then I didn't.\\nI guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again.\\n\\nKadir  3:01\\nOK.\\nThat's fair and OK, so.\\n\\nP3   3:03\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  3:08\\nJust uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago.\\nSo can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?\\nUmm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.\\nJust a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.\\n\\nP3   3:44\\nYeah, I like.\\nSo with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.\\nThings to see in a specific place.\\nSo if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.\\nWhat places can I see or what places can I eat?\\nAnd I like some of the suggestions that it gives.\\n\\nKadir  4:05\\nHmm.\\nSo mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions.\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   4:10\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  4:10\\nYeah.\\nSo make sense so.\\nDo you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those?\\nRecommendations for eating out or for a place to visit?\\n\\nP3   4:31\\nYeah.\\nSo when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.\\nSo then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.\\n\\nKadir  4:50\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   4:52\\nSo I liked that it kept that in mind.\\n\\nKadir  4:54\\nOK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?\\n\\nP3   5:08\\nUh.\\nOK, so if I were to put it on a scale of.\\n\\nKadir  5:15\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   5:16\\nI don't know one to five.\\nI guess I would say.\\n2 1/2.\\n\\nKadir  5:24\\nOK, in the middle. Mediocre.\\n\\nP3   5:25\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  5:28\\nOK.\\nIs there any?\\n\\nP3   5:32\\nReason.\\n\\nKadir  5:33\\nReason that led to this rating.\\n\\nP3   5:41\\nI just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.\\n\\nKadir  5:48\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   5:48\\nIf I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.\\n\\nKadir  6:10\\nHmm. Uh, OK, but.\\n\\nP3   6:16\\nSo I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.\\n\\nKadir  6:42\\nOh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?\\n\\nP3   6:59\\nUmm. Sorry, let me think.\\n\\nKadir  7:13\\nYes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.\\n\\nP3   7:24\\nUmm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.\\nI didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.\\n\\nKadir  7:45\\nUmm. Umm.\\n\\nP3   7:49\\nOtherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.\\n\\nShristi   8:14\\nIf it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff.\\n\\nP3   8:21\\nYeah, that helps.\\n\\nShristi   8:26\\nYeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like.\\n\\nP3   8:31\\nOK Ohh now I remember.\\nOK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.\\n\\nKadir  9:00\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   9:01\\nSo I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that.\\n\\nKadir  9:09\\nOK, OK. Yeah. Standing so. How much effort was required to use my AI chatbot? Uh. During your experiences?\\n\\nP3   9:27\\nUmm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about.\\nTo being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.\\nUmm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.\\n\\nKadir  10:05\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   10:07\\nBut yeah, I would say so.\\n\\nKadir  10:09\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   10:11\\nA little bit of effort, but not not much.\\n\\nKadir  10:14\\nNot much, OK. OK. Umm do you think? If any special skills are needed to use my AI chatbot well.\\n\\nP3   10:35\\nUmm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  10:45\\nHmm.\\nIf I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]?\\nCan, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want.\\nSo and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require?\\n\\nP3   11:18\\nUmm, so could you repeat that question?\\n\\nKadir  11:23\\nI'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question.\\nYou said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want.\\nAnd was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?\\n\\nP3   11:48\\nOhh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it.\\n\\nKadir  12:05\\nUmm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI?\\n\\nP3   12:24\\nUmm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK.\\n\\nKadir  12:45\\nRight. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK.\\n\\nP3   12:55\\nYeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant.\\n\\nKadir  13:17\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   13:17\\nAnd I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine.\\nAnd then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad.\\nIt was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but.\\n\\nKadir  13:38\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   13:38\\nBut I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice.\\n\\nKadir  13:46\\nUmm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   13:59\\nOhh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out.\\nCould you repeat that?\\n\\nKadir  14:07\\nSure.\\nDo you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\\n\\nP3   14:21\\nOhm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:31\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   14:35\\nBut if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI.\\n\\nKadir  14:44\\nOK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else?\\n\\nP3   15:04\\nOhm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture.\\nI don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  15:39\\nMm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that.\\n\\nP3   15:53\\nYeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.\\n \\nKadir  16:02\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   16:02\\nUmm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation.\\n\\nKadir  16:12\\nUmm.\\nHmm.\\nIt seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human.\\nUh. Features.\\n\\nP3   16:32\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  16:35\\nOK.\\nU], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII?\\n\\nP3   16:46\\nOhm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI.\\nSo then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you?\\n\\nKadir  17:02\\nHmm.\\n\\nP3   17:08\\nI don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do.\\nAnd I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that.\\n\\nKadir  17:21\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   17:25\\nWhen it first came out.\\n\\nKadir  17:27\\nOK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms.\\n\\nP3   17:37\\nYeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it.\\n\\nKadir  17:57\\nOK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm.\\nOn on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study.\\n\\nP3   18:20\\nI feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically.\\n\\nKadir  18:53\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   18:55\\nI think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very.\\nHow do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more.\\n\\nKadir  19:29\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   19:38\\nSo it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.\\n\\nKadir  19:46\\nOK, OK.\\nUmm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:09\\nGonna say that hasn't really changed.\\n\\nKadir  20:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:13\\nHow are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could.\\n\\nKadir  20:19\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   20:28\\nIt could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI.\\n\\nKadir  20:40\\nOK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI?\\n\\nP3   20:54\\nUmm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know.\\n\\nKadir  20:59\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   21:04\\nLike if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand.\\n\\nKadir  21:13\\nMm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity or difference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT.\\n\\nP3   21:43\\nI guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that.\\n\\nKadir  22:33\\nUmm. Hmm. OK.\\nUmm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with.\\nUmm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your?\\nPrompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them?\\n\\nP3   23:09\\nOh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah.\\n\\nKadir  23:12\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   23:15\\nI felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary.\\n\\nKadir  23:26\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nP3   23:31\\nUmm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time.\\n\\nKadir  23:41\\nSo it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a.\\n\\nP3   23:46\\nUmhm.\\n\\nKadir  23:47\\nSo you can't make it on and off.\\n\\nP3   23:51\\nOh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off?\\n\\nKadir  23:55\\nI don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either.\\n\\nP3   23:57\\nOhh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links.\\nI might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would.\\n\\nKadir  24:07\\nWhat?\\n\\nP3   24:07\\nIt would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:28\\nOK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it?\\nCan I quickly ask?\\n\\nP3   24:41\\nOh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright.\\n\\nKadir  24:44\\nYeah.\\nOr you said you were watching it, right?\\n\\nP3   24:47\\nOh, oh, no, no.\\nI was just, uh, I just said Ohh.\\nI think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip and then that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after.\\n\\nKadir  24:54\\nYeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements.\\nAlso, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very?\\nGeneric.\\n\\nP3   25:27\\nI think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about.\\n\\nKadir  25:33\\nUmm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses?\\n\\nP3   25:49\\nWell, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses.\\n\\nKadir  26:02\\nDid you? Yeah.\\n\\nP3   26:02\\nSo I I feel like it's probably 50-50.\\n\\nKadir  26:06\\nHmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers.\\n\\nP3   26:26\\nUmm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists.\\n\\nKadir  26:39\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   26:43\\nBut yeah, that that's all I really had the chance to look at.\\n\\nKadir  26:48\\nAnd then what was your shopping experience by the way, can you remind that to us? Shopping task.\\n\\nP3   26:55\\nYeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for.\\n\\nKadir  27:08\\nRight.\\n\\nP3   27:09\\nI don't know places that I had really good deals.\\n\\nKadir  27:13\\nOK.\\n\\nP3   27:15\\nAnd it was giving me.\\n\\nKadir  27:15\\nOr yeah, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:17\\nOhh sorry what?\\n\\nKadir  27:19\\nStores,. You mean?\\nYeah.\\n\\nP3   27:20\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:20\\nI just remember, yeah.\\n\\nP3   27:22\\nYeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person.\\n\\nKadir  27:35\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   27:35\\nOne of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah.\\n\\nKadir  27:43\\nOK.\\nOK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform?\\n\\nP3   28:15\\nUmm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached.\\nI don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it.\\n\\nKadir  28:41\\nHmm.\\nOK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense.\\nUmm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly?\\n\\nP3   29:05\\nOhm.\\nI guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries.\\nEven if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.\\n\\nKadir  29:57\\nOK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more.\\n\\nP3   29:59\\nYeah.\\n\\nKadir  30:02\\nOK.\\nYeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again.\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for attending us.\\nI don't know if should see as a question or not, but.\\n\\nShristi   30:15\\nUmm I I have a few more questions.\\nI'll just go ahead and ask your.\\nSo do you see just to reel back a little bit?\\n\\nP3   30:20\\nOK.\\n\\nShristi   30:25\\nSo I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries.\\n\\nP3   30:47\\nOhh yeah.\\n\\nShristi   30:51\\nAnd then? You asked it.\\nHey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right?\\nAnd then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it.\\nAnd then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think.\\nAnd it said, hey, what else is going on?\\nAre there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshots after that?\\nSo did you, like, continue the conversation after that?\\nDo you remember anything from that day regarding it?\\n\\nP3   31:24\\nOhh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that?\\n\\nShristi   31:42\\nUmm.\\n\\nP3   31:43\\nSo I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like.\\n\\nShristi   31:44\\nOK.\\nHmm.\\nOK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new?\\nConversation starters.\\nUh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it.\\nSo how do you feel about that interaction in general?\\n\\nP3   32:15\\nUh.\\nI feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm.\\nAnd when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person.\\n\\nShristi   32:51\\nUmm OK.\\n\\nP3   32:52\\nSo it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer.\\n\\nShristi   32:57\\nUmm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or five different things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for.\\n\\nP3   33:36\\nI want to say it's good for.\\nI mean, I keep bringing this up, but.\\nSince I like food, I like exploring new food places.\\nI like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even?\\nUmm definitely.\\nWhen I've tried to talk to ChatGPT.\\nYeah, it's just kind of curves me.\\nIt's like, OK, ask me the question now.\\nAnd even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue.\\nHaving a conversation with you as long as you wanted to.\\nUmm. What?\\nIt's bad for though.\\nI'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate.\\nIf that mean it's even less accurate, there we go.\\nIn a lot of a lot of things.\\nSo I think that's what it's bad that.\\n\\nShristi   34:46\\nMm-hmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOhm.\\nSo I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left.\\nI guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK.\\nSo final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly?\\n\\nP3   35:41\\nI wish there was.\\nI don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.\\nI don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for.\\nIt's just.\\nI just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but.\\nBecause I I still didn't even know what it was for.\\nReally, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for.\\nMaybe.\\nBut even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for.\\nIf it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources.\\n\\nShristi   36:29\\nHmm.\\nYeah, makes sense.\\nOK, I think that's all I had.\\nSo thank you so much.\\nI'll.\\nI'll pass it back to Kadir.\\nWhere you left it off.\\n\\nKadir  36:45\\nYeah.\\nThank you very much for.\\nYeah.\\nHating in our diary study.\\nAnd so at the same time, and enjoy.\\nUh, Daisy.\\nUh, let's just kind of like is our session very much.\\nWould you like to right now?\\n\\nP3   37:11\\nOh wait, sorry.\\nDid you say something like?\\nAre you asking me a question?\\n\\nKadir  37:14\\nI'm just saying, are we?\\nAre we able to right now end the conversation the interview?\\n\\nP3   37:20\\nOh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nVery good.\\n\\nKadir  37:29\\nBye, bye.\\n\\nP3   37:30\\nGoodbye.\\n\\nShristi stopped transcription\", \"Transcript P1_Interview March 11, 2024, 7:05PM Shristi 0:07 Ok. OK, so we have started the recording and transcription. I just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself? P1 0:21 Sure. Umm. So my name is [--]. I'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program. This is my second to last semester. Umm before that I'm. I'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years. Decided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer. Shristi 1:02 Umm, thank you. So which social media platforms are using currently? P1 1:10 Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok. Shristi 1:22 And Tiktok. OK umm so. Umm. So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so? P1 1:31 Umm. Shristi 1:38 Do you remember when you started using Snapchat? P1 1:41 Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I ﬁrst started using it.And I was deﬁnitely a lot more active on it early on. I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much. And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories. Shristi 2:15 Umm. P1 2:20 So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much. And my friends aren't. I don't go it on it too much anymore. I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing. Shristi 2:36 Umm. OK. So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera? P1 2:51 Yeah. So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notiﬁcations from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories. Shristi 3:16 OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family? P1 3:23 I do. It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while. Shristi 3:30 Yeah, and. P1 3:34 And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot. So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends. Like if I think of them every once in a while.Shristi 3:54 Hmm. OK, makes sense. So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study? P1 4:03 Umm, I actually have not used it. I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my ﬁrst thought was like I really had no interest in trying it. Umm. Shristi 4:20 Yeah. OK. P1 4:21 It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it. Like back when it was ﬁrst released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out. Shristi 4:53 Yeah, yeah, of course. Ohm. So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now. P1 5:06 Umm. Shristi 5:06 Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI? So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went. P1 5:23 Sure. Shristi 5:27 If you remember it. P1 5:29 Yeah. So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?Shristi 5:35 Yeah, of course. P1 5:37 OK, sure. So the one I remember the most was my ﬁrst time using it. Umm. And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US. Shristi 5:56 Umm. P1 6:00 And so for that one. I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me. Shristi 6:07 Umm. P1 6:08 Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good. Shristi 6:16 Mm-hmm. P1 6:16 So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar. So like I think the ﬁrst thing I said was like, hi, how are you? Shristi 6:28 Umm. P1 6:32 Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model. Shristi 6:41 No. P1 6:42 So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that. And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.And I've noticed that my like conversation. No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back. Well, at ﬁrst I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts. P1 8:15 Umm. So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions. Shristi 8:34 Umm. P1 8:35 And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the ﬁnal recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night. So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary. I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by. Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days. Shristi 9:30 Umm. P1 9:45 And I'm like, I don't know about that. Shristi 9:48 Yeah.P1 9:48 And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources. Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in. Shristi 10:46 Mm-hmm. P1 10:46 And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore. Shristi 10:55 Yeah. P1 10:58 Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like. Shristi 10:59 Umm, you know? P1 11:02 I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip. Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was ﬁne. Shristi 11:14 Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else. P1 11:27 Yeah. Shristi 11:28 So yeah, so much for sharing that. So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?P1 11:37 Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better. Shristi 12:24 Umm. P1 12:24 Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me? And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary. Shristi 12:40 Umm. P1 12:43 A recommendation was deﬁnitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker. Shristi 13:01 Umm. Umm, OK, thank you. So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back? P1 13:34 Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation. I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time. Shristi 13:55 Hmm hmm. P1 14:06 Umm. Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option. Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should havelike asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews. Shristi 14:52 Mm-hmm. P1 14:56 Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products. Shristi 15:10 Yep. P1 15:11 It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that. Shristi 15:30 Umm. Given of course. OK, makes sense. So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot? P1 15:46 Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time. Shristi 16:30 Umm OK. P1 16:33 So pretty effortless. Shristi 16:36 OK. So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well? P1 16:47 Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.Shristi 17:00 Umm. P1 17:01 You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations. Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed. And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human. Shristi 17:42 Umm. P1 17:44 So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it. Shristi 17:52 OK, so did you encounter any speciﬁc obstacles when you were using the tool? P1 18:05 And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones. Shristi 18:29 Hmm. So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers? P1 18:43 Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh. Shristi 18:49 OK. P1 18:52 OK. Can you guys hear me alright? Shristi 18:54 Yeah, we do. P1 18:56Uh, yeah. So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like. Can you give me links with pictures? So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing. But in other times. I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like speciﬁc models of backpacks within this brand and like speciﬁc colors. It then gave me speciﬁc models but not speciﬁc colors. Shristi 20:00 Umm. OK. Makes sense. So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the speciﬁc feature properly. P1 20:27 Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it. Shristi 20:50 OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it. P1 21:12 Umm. Shristi 21:14 So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard? P1 21:18 Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it. Shristi 21:48 Umm. P1 21:48 Uh, or like banter with it? And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one speciﬁcally, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out. Shristi 22:32 Oh really? P1 22:33 Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm. Shristi 22:43 Umm. P1 22:46 Umm. And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it. That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer. Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers. Shristi 23:07 Yeah. P1 23:11 Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing. Shristi 23:21 Yeah. P1 23:23 So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people. Shristi 23:28 OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it? P1 23:43 Umm, I would say no. Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny. But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing. Shristi 24:10Makes sense. Ohm so. So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone? P1 24:26 Umm. I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh. What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it. Shristi 25:28 Umm. P1 25:36 So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever. Shristi 25:36 Umm. P1 25:41 Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all. Shristi 25:45 Yeah, makes sense. P1 25:49 Yeah. Shristi 25:50 So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI? P1 26:04 No, I I don't think so. Shristi 26:07 Hmm, OK. So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI? P1 26:21 I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.Shristi 26:27 Umm so so. P1 26:28 Which is just, yeah. Shristi 26:30 Hmm. So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT. So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines? P1 26:49 Umm. I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example. Shristi 27:20 Mm-hmm. Umm. P1 27:29 Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others. Shristi 28:21 Umm. Umm yeah, sure. So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have? P1 28:40 I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm. I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure. Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need. And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not speciﬁcally asking likethe Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like. Shristi 29:51 Umm. OK. Makes sense. Umm. So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things? P1 30:08 Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this. Shristi 30:22 Umm. P1 30:31 Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere. Shristi 30:35 Umm. P1 30:36 Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different. Shristi 31:06 Yeah, I think that's that's fair. So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads? P1 31:19 Umm. Ohh no, I don't think so. Shristi 31:28 Ohh OK really OK. P1 31:30 Yeah. Shristi 31:32 Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding backand giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least. P1 31:48 Yeah. Shristi 31:49 And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat? P1 32:02 Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin. Shristi 32:10 OK. Yeah. P1 32:11 Yeah. Shristi 32:11 So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed. P1 32:15 It just knows, yeah. Shristi 32:17 Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then. OK, so so when you receive any recommendations. So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that? P1 32:42 Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way. Shristi 33:06 OK, makes sense. P1 33:08 Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.Shristi 33:29 Mm-hmm. P1 33:33 It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not. Shristi 33:45 Umm. Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you ﬁnish the conversation. P1 33:53 I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that. Shristi 34:11 Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry. P1 34:42 Uh, yeah. Shristi 34:42 Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reﬂect back on that experience a little bit for us? P1 34:53 Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to ﬂy? Shristi 35:15 This is. P1 35:20 And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke. Shristi 35:27 Umm. Yeah.P1 35:32 And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it. Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes? And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it. Shristi 36:11 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously. P1 36:22 Yeah. Shristi 36:24 Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you ﬁlters. P1 36:34 Ohh yeah. Shristi 36:34 Ohm, I'm so. So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us? P1 36:42 Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like. P1 36:56 Ask it to recommend a ﬁlter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and ﬁrst of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway. Shristi 37:00 Umm. Umm. P1 37:11 So I don't know what that was about. Shristi 37:15 OK.P1 37:16 But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a ﬁlter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat ﬁlter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the ﬁlter homepage. Shristi 37:45 Umm. P1 37:47 Of the camera like tab. Shristi 37:49 The where we where we take, where we take new snaps. P1 37:53 Yeah. Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the ﬁlters. Shristi 38:00 Umm. P1 38:00 It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that speciﬁc cat ﬁlter. Shristi 38:04 That OK. Umm, so. So when you were not able to reach the speciﬁc ﬁlter, how how did it make you feel at the time? P1 38:19 You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this ﬁlter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah. Shristi 38:45 Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right. P1 38:49 Yeah. Mm-hmm. Shristi 38:51 OK. Yeah, makes sense. OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more speciﬁc I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you ﬁnd the responses by MyAI? P1 39:17 Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual? Shristi 39:24 Yeah. In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes? P1 39:45 Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times. So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to. Shristi 40:11 Umm. P1 40:31 But I wouldn't take it at face value. Shristi 40:38 Yeah, right. P1 40:40 And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other? Shristi 41:01 Umm. P1 41:01 Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account? Does it know how expensive it is? Shristi 41:09 Umm. P1 41:11 Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?Shristi 41:15 Yeah. P1 41:16 It's like for like minute details. I I would do that research on my own. Shristi 41:23 Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with. P1 41:34 Basically, yeah. Shristi 41:35 Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those? P1 42:11 Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself? Shristi 42:37 I mean. P1 42:41 So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself. Shristi 42:52 Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reﬂecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for? P1 43:16 Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively. Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to ﬁgure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality orsomething to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future. Shristi 44:02 OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and. Kadir 44:05 I have a quick question. I have a quick question. P1 44:09 Yeah. Kadir 44:09 Just before ﬁnishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate. P1 44:24 Umm. Kadir 44:27 I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that? P1 44:54 Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference. Kadir 45:13 Umm. P1 45:13 Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human. And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even. Kadir 45:29 Hmm. P1 45:32 Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the SnapchatAI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT. Kadir 46:06 Umm. Shristi 46:12 No. Yeah. Kadir 46:14 Hmm. Hmm, yeah. Shristi 46:17 Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for speciﬁcally for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for? P1 46:37 Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned? Shristi 47:01 Umm. P1 47:01 I'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games. Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it. Shristi 47:09 Umm. P1 47:11 Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games. Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or. Shristi 47:28 Umm. P1 47:30 If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.Shristi 47:49 Umm. P1 47:59 So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case. Kadir 48:07 Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here. Shristi 48:14 Umm. Kadir 48:17 That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that? P1 48:47 Uh, could you say that again? So like uh? Kadir 48:51 Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings. P1 49:09 Yes. Kadir 49:26 As far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong. P1 49:27 Yes. Kadir 49:29 And how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI? P1 49:49Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine. Kadir 50:07 Mm-hmm. P1 50:08 That's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations. Kadir 50:13 Umm. P1 50:15 And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more. Kadir 50:29 Umm. P1 50:40 Or, uh, like like human? Like so. Kadir 50:46 Umm. P1 50:46 Like if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know. Like why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers. Kadir 50:54 Umm. Yeah. Thanks very much. P1 51:07 Yeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted. Kadir 51:13 Ohh wait, you're you're muted. Shristi 51:16 I do it all the time. I'm sorry.P1 51:18 Yeah, yeah. Shristi 51:19 So yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention? P1 51:30 No, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun. Thanks for inviting me to participate. Shristi 51:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Kadir 51:37 Deﬁnitely. Shristi 51:37 Yeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK Shristi stopped transcription\"]\n",

      "Yeah. So. So I'm like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you're doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it's like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it's kind of like to. So what you're doing on a bit daily basis, so it's kind of fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   3:28\n",
      "OK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   3:32\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   3:45\n",
      "OK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   4:02\n",
      "Uh, so when it was first released, I don't know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don't know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was first released, but to be honest, after that I haven't really used this before this program or before your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   4:10\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   4:22\n",
      "So yeah, I don't have very much experience than you guys as well, so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   4:22\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Yeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   4:32\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   4:35\n",
      "Yeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   4:39\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat field whenever you Instagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   4:44\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   4:45\n",
      "So it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven't really used it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   4:53\n",
      "OK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   5:07\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   5:08\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   5:08\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   5:09\n",
      "So then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn't related to the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   5:21\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you first was. What was the first task? If you can remind me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   5:34\n",
      "I think we asked you to have a travel recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   5:39\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn't think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days.\n",
      "I have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the first answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   5:58\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   6:03\n",
      "It give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing.\n",
      "So I..I was kind of like I didn't check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   6:20\n",
      "Ohh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   6:27\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   6:27\n",
      "OK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that first task?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   6:40\n",
      "No, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So first of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   6:59\n",
      "OK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   7:16\n",
      "My prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the \"guess the country's flag\" game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that's all I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   7:34\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   7:36\n",
      "It's like kind of. It's not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it's it's kind of cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   7:47\n",
      "Yeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don't know, like kill time at the time and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   7:53\n",
      "You're saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   8:08\n",
      "Mm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   8:31\n",
      "OK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I'm working on my thesis or something like that. So it's really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that's why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I've used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   9:01\n",
      "Hmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   9:17\n",
      "With my expectations, OK, so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   9:20\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   9:24\n",
      "Umm. Let's see. I'm gonna. I'm going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   9:37\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   9:39\n",
      "It didn't perform that well on this one. So I think the first the first tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me first suggestion on soccer cleats but didn't like it, didn't like provide like such great information on that.\n",
      "And also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn't recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period.\n",
      "It's going like provide much information about there.\n",
      "So I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   10:41\n",
      "The first one.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   10:42\n",
      "Yeah. The first one was the. Yeah, it was the best one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   10:46\n",
      "The the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   10:52\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   10:54\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:03\n",
      "I..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:10\n",
      "Rocky mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:11\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:14\n",
      "So do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:20\n",
      "That's where I would go. Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "I gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:23\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:29\n",
      "So and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that's a place where I would definitely go in the future, so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:36\n",
      "Maybe that's why you it could be aligning. OK, OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:40\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:40\n",
      "I totally understand. Yeah. So then also, yeah. Can you share an experience where it didn't meet your expectations? And then yeah, that would be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   11:50\n",
      "No. OK, OK. So let me go over the task with the shopping list, right? The..where you wanted to do like buy something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   11:59\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   12:05\n",
      "I really needed a new..\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   12:06\n",
      "You wanted to buy, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   12:08\n",
      "Yeah, I I needed a new soccer cleats right now, so I just try to like incorporate that in the task as well. So I asked him to like, suggest me some soccer cleats based on my position of play like soccer field. So I play midfielders generally, so I wanted something light and something that lasted me long because last soccer cleat that I bought was like only for three or four months.\n",
      "It suggested me like 2..2 of the like most famous soccer cleats, which were like all over the Internet as so. Yeah. And I asked like, it is a well out of my budget. So can you like say say something in between like 150 to $200.00 but it still gave me the same same two models that it showed me like previously and after that what I did was I asked for like the pictures.\n",
      "Like the pictures, if if you provide like pictures from the Internet but no it it couldn't provide that\n",
      "So I think that was the worst experience with me. So it's sort of like a prompt insert a picture of [inaudible] within like big brackets. You can see in the screenshots so it was kind of like not that good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   13:14\n",
      "Yeah. What was lacking in in that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   13:17\n",
      "Yeah. So I I I asked the picture of like 2 soccer cleats that it was trying to show me earlier and it couldn't like provide me the picture and also the it couldn't like uh what do you say..suggest the price..uh..the cleats within my budget so. It it only knew about like 2 soccer cleats and it kind of like repeatedly went on and went on about the same thing again and again even if you asked like different questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   13:46\n",
      "Umm, so it was not.. OK. Yeah, I I I got it. Definitely. So, uh, how much effort was required to use MyAI chatbot in your experiences so far?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   14:05\n",
      "I guess it depends on like what kind of question you're asking. So again, so the first task that I did was like pretty smooth and I got what was required within like 3 or 4 questions or prompts.\n",
      "But for the..as I have said like..\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   14:17\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   14:21\n",
      "The soccer cleats one.. the shopping list and also the describe the picture or something like that. So it took like will more than like ten tries to get even get like close to it. So it was like stuck on one thing and it's going to go like up from that. So even if I ask a lot of questions, so yeah, I think it depends on my experience. It depends on what you're actually trying to ask out of the MyAI feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   14:46\n",
      "OK. So then as far as I understand, do you mean, I mean it depends on the topic. It depends on.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   14:53\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. It depends on the topic and how well known the topic is. I most probably because National parks are like more searched than football cleats..I guess..all over the Internet and yeah, I did ask it about like this dish from [a South Asian Country] during my photo.. Task with the photo uploading a picture and then asking about the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it couldn't recognize that, and even if I like told it that it was like a dish from [a South Asian Country]. So it could not provide much information about that as well. So I think it depends on how what would people like asking the in the Internet more. So if you like talk about a least talked topic with the MyAI think it just like other time to like actually go into the topic you like you'll be stuck somewhere around like in the first two or three replies and then if you like try to get more out of it..it will take some time on those kind of topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   15:28\n",
      "OK. Umm. I I get it. Yeah. When it start then it's it's not maybe forwarding with the conversation, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   16:01\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   16:02\n",
      "OK. So, uh, uh, do you think any skills are needed? Uh, any any skills are needed to use MyAI chatbot well or effectively let's say.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   16:19\n",
      "I think even like no basic English writing and reading then it would be enough. You doing anything so that you just need to know about the Snapchat interface interface and just the basic English that you do writing, typing, reading. So I think that that that's enough.So I don't think that's like too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   16:37\n",
      "Umm, so basically kind of English proficiency and then kind of writing, typing and you said writing typing.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   16:43\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   16:45\n",
      "I mean, do you think? By writing, is there any? Specific skills for.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   16:55\n",
      "And not have I just writing because like the way the AI AI reacts to your message like it largely or it mostly depends on your prompt right.\n",
      "If you like, try to get trying to get some information out of the MyAI but you are not like expressing yourself well in the prompt. So then it will like take wrong turn on like it will not understand what you'd like to say. So if you have like good understanding of English writing and reading and then a good understanding of Snapchat because you have to first of all go to MyAI to like type type it out. So if you have a good knowledge of that interface, then I think anyone can do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   17:28\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   17:32\n",
      "Anyone, anyone can utilize this yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   17:33\n",
      "OK. OK. So just here I have one more follow up. So then do you think in terms of writing or typing? Different writing and prompting would would would differ. Do you think I mean how is your experience with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   17:59\n",
      "I think so. Yeah, I think like the way you write or like the way you present a prompt to an to MyAI. So it will definitely like the answer would be definitely different, so I don't know how to fix it, but yeah, if you like, try a write a prompt in it like a detailed manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   18:09\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   18:15\n",
      "So you should like express all the things that you need to get out of my head. Sometimes it might work, but sometimes it can't, like necessarily pushes all the information. I think like that.\n",
      "So that's why I always like start with the small short short, short prompt and then try to go into deep into the conversation after it kind of like replies in a good way or replies in a good direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   18:32\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   18:37\n",
      "So if yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   18:39\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "And in your experiences during the diary study or prior, did you encounter any obstacles when using MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   18:56\n",
      "Obstacles. And does advertisements count as obstacle? Because I received like a lot of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   19:03\n",
      "Hmm so.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   19:05\n",
      "Yeah, they were like a lot of extra, but it's advertisements which are not related to my prompts or anything like that. So this has been like annoying. Other than that, I don't think so. I like a little bit of trouble uploading a picture. I don't know why it like took a lot of long time. It took like about one minute to upload a picture, so I think those two are the major things that I did not like or would say obstacles while doing your the diary stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   19:27\n",
      "Mm-hmm. So what makes advertisements? Kind of like annoying for you. Or think you are that they are, they might be obstacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   19:44\n",
      "So if if the advertisement are like what I'm looking for. So if I'm like if they are like what, how do I put it? So if I see a random advertisement on my screen, so it must be like something related to what I'm trying to say, right to MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   19:58\n",
      "Hearing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   19:59\n",
      "But it is like some random kind of thing, like some magazine covers or something like that.\n",
      "So which I haven't really talked about it with MyAI then I think that it's like kind of annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   20:11\n",
      "OK, OK. Yeah, yeah, definitely. If if it's not related to your purpose, I understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   20:16\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   20:16\n",
      "Yep. Uh. So. Do you like? Do you feel like you have access to necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   20:29\n",
      "Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   20:31\n",
      "OK. So that's that's fair enough. And have you heard somebody in your circle or environment else talk about MyAI before?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   20:49\n",
      "When, it like first came out. Yes, but after that I don't think like anybody is using it would even though people using Snapchat. So when it first came out, like we were like, kind of, what do you say we were like, trying to see what that was? So it was introduced as your personal assistant on Snapchat first. So before MyAI, I think so it it was introduced as personal assistant.\n",
      "So I had like few talks with it and also some of my friends did as well. So yeah, but I don't think it's like that, that that used right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   21:18\n",
      "And. OK so.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   21:22\n",
      "I can't speak for all of all of us, but that's what I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   21:27\n",
      "OK, so it can be a friend. It can be an acquaintance or a media, so probably you've heard from friends when it came up first. As far as I understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   21:36\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be your friend as well. So as I told you earlier, so when I was stuck once in the airport so I had nothing to do with having to talk with an AI. So yeah, it it did help me at that time. So it can be your friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   21:48\n",
      "OK. OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   21:49\n",
      "You're gonna situation, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   21:51\n",
      "Yeah. So then yeah, it's more like if you if you, I mean you said for example you might be considering it as a friend or maybe personal assistant. So does this affect anything or how does it, you know affect you communication with with MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   22:17\n",
      "So if you're like trying to like, uh, if you think of it as a friend, I think, and your prompt are what you type into the my hair would be like a lot of a lot friendly. So I think that's the only thing.\n",
      "So what? What you consider it as if you like. Think of it like a search engine. Or like, uh, yeah, feature that will help you to get some information. So you are prompt would would would be formal and you would like have to like type it in a detail. But if you like using it for fun so it can be like short and like silly kind of prompts because you that depends on the intent of use right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   22:51\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   22:53\n",
      "So I think there's there's the rest of the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   22:57\n",
      "OK. Yeah, so. Have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   23:11\n",
      "No, not exactly MyAI, but like another a lot of other generative AI, so even my professor my advisor tells me to like properly use like ChatGPT or something like that. Other generative AI, but not exactly my Snapchat. Yeah, because I think the demographics are the people using my AI is like kind of like limited to teenagers right now. So they are not the guys who I would take advice with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   23:32\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   23:35\n",
      "So I think that that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   23:37\n",
      "Well, OK, OK, I got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   23:38\n",
      "We could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   23:41\n",
      "So would you recommend trying myAI to your friends?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   23:49\n",
      "Yes, you're I can do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   23:54\n",
      "And why?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   23:55\n",
      "But but according to the user's there, according to the uses, if they want to like search for anything specific then I wouldn't like tell them to go to go and search in MyAI because I don't think like it's like that effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   23:55\n",
      "Why would you?\n",
      "Why would you?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   24:09\n",
      "But if they just want to have fun, I can like this. Suggest them this. Speak with MyAI in the future. It was one like I can say like that, but if they want like get some information out of MyAI, then I would not recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   24:22\n",
      "OK, OK. And since starting using my I have you noticed any changes in your social media habits?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   24:34\n",
      "No, no, I I have noticed with I think it is just the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   24:35\n",
      "General social media habits, I mean. OK. Uh, do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   24:52\n",
      "My uh, yeah, I use like ChatGPT on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   24:57\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   24:57\n",
      "All the other than that, I don't think I have like much explicit experience with other generative AI apps or some like that. I think that ChatGPT is the only one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   25:07\n",
      "OK. Yeah. I asked this but still I wanna ask. Maybe a kind of follow up. What is similar between chat GPT and MyAI or? And what is different in essence?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   25:25\n",
      "OK. So in essence, OK, so the I think what I feel is like ChatGPT, if you like ask any questions.\n",
      "So it will like generally it will respond in like formal matters like and I use it like more more for like formal things. So if I have to write to mail and I want to like make like make it like good I ask such as visual change the mail and change the mail to a better format. And if I'm writing a document and I think that my English is a little bit bad, then I asked the charge to change it into kind of like formal or like more scientific terms or write in a better way or for clarity or something like that. So I think it's like more more used in like office kind of work with ChatGPT.\n",
      "Uh, for me personally, so actually use this during my thesis.. so during my thesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use this use this a lot but MyAI I think it's just like as I said earlier. So I we can use it as a friend.\n",
      "So if I you don't need to be like that formal it doesn't. It doesn't become that formal with you in the responses, so it's like kind of like friendly chat I felt. So yeah, I think the main difference between that is like my uses, it depends on my users as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   26:33\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   26:39\n",
      "So I use my.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   26:40\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   26:41\n",
      "I use ChatGPT for like a lot of things in my work, but yeah, MyAI not that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   26:45\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Umm uh, yeah, I think this is this is pretty helpful. So I remember you also were telling about you use ChatGPT on your desktop and then MyAI on your phone so.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   27:01\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   27:05\n",
      "Other than kind of like categorizing you said ChatGPT, for more formal stuff for more. Maybe professional stuff versus check MyAI, more personal, maybe more lightweight.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   27:16\n",
      "Yes. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   27:17\n",
      "So what characteristics? What characteristics of MyAI leads to that kind of like perception or perspective for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   27:32\n",
      "Uh, so yeah, if you like, look at some of the things, some of the screenshots. So the way that MyAI reply is, so it's like pretty like informal, if you see uses like worse like oops, my bad something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   27:42\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   27:46\n",
      "So the things that you use and in like daily conversation with the friends and all so and it it is like kind of like what do you say expressive of its emotion? I think so because like it it kind of like if I tell it that it is wrong, then it says like, oops, I'm..I'm so sorry for that. Something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   28:03\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   28:04\n",
      "We don't see in terms if you did that often, so eventually like give a prompt, then it will just say something formally. So I think this is the main reason why is why I said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   28:14\n",
      "More conversational features of language. Uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   28:18\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   28:19\n",
      "Supposed in my AI any have you? I don't know. Like would you like to eligible bit comment on any. Like interface features like any features that MyAI has, make it more personal or versus impersonal.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   28:39\n",
      "Interface features. Uh, I think it's just like chatting with a friend right in MyAI. So if you if you have seen the interface of my AI so it's like exactly the same as like other Snapchat chats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   28:47\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   28:56\n",
      "And so it has like a place to, like, upload your pictures or something like that. Send a sticker, sticker or even like voice memos, which you don't see in ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   29:03\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   29:04\n",
      "So yeah, I think that all the interface is is it is like making it is like designed to be like your personal friend or assistant like that's what I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   29:15\n",
      "OK. OK, definitely indefinitely. That makes sense. So I think you said this, you saw some ads or sponsored content while interacting with MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   29:30\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   29:30\n",
      "And then you're feeling was OK. I'm skipping this question because you already kind of responded to that, sorry. So in terms of in your conversation with my I, how reliable do you find the responses by MyAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   29:51\n",
      "Reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   29:52\n",
      "Yeah. Do you think the responses from my AI have reliable they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   29:57\n",
      "So far I don't think I can see that I can answer this question right now because I haven't like cross checked, but it uh answered me because I actually to like give me an itinerary with all the pricing and the budgeting. But I haven't like looked into how accurate that was really. But I know from the fact that it gave me like wrong information on the soccer fields, so I would say not that reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   30:21\n",
      "Hmm. Yeah. With soccer cleats I? When I looked at your screenshots, umm for all the options it was offering giving the same price right?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   30:33\n",
      "Yeah, I I told it like it. My budget is like $150.00 and give me a price range for all of the soccer cleats, but I think it it all showed the same pricing like $150.00 for everything yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   30:47\n",
      "And then it's kind of like a question mark, I I see, like I, yeah, so you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI, for example, I've seen a you you share your picture with the chat, but what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by MyAI on Snapchat or by Snapchat let's say?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   30:49\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, I I couldn't get the last part like that. Good. Can you like repeat that again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   31:20\n",
      "Sure you shared. Let me quickly be we're waiting. You might have shared something personal when interacting with the my AI chat bot and what are your concerns regarding how the information you share is used by Snapchat.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   31:38\n",
      "Used by Snapchat.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   31:42\n",
      "I don't think I have, like, ever thought of thought it. So what I think what do you want me to say in that regard? If my information or like pictures are used by the Snapchat itself, the Snapchat app or like my AI in a different way, is like going to be what you say public on the Internet or something like that. I couldn't get the question completely so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   32:08\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   32:41\n",
      "OK, it's alright. Yeah, I'm not that concerned because all everything like you say right now or in the modern day world like they know it all, I think so they can like hear us like through our phones. And so if you look at the ads given by Facebook is like kind of even if I speak in [home country language] with my friend, it kind of latches onto that and shows me the air of the same thing in Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   33:09\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   33:11\n",
      "So I think our data is being like sold everywhere right now. So I I don't mind. I don't mind it.\n",
      "I..I'm not that concerned about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir   33:26\n",
      "OK, I think I this is totally fair. I think this kind of brings us to the end of our conversation. Do you have anything at the very end to add or to emphasize before we hung up?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2   33:44\n",

      "Yeah.\n",

      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  2:43\n",

      "\n",
      "P3   2:52\n",
      "I used it when it first came out and then I didn't.\n",

      "So can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?\n",
      "Umm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.\n",
      "Just a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   3:44\n",
      "Yeah, I like.\n",
      "So with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.\n",
      "Things to see in a specific place.\n",
      "So if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kadir  4:05\n",
      "Hmm.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "P3   4:31\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.\n",
      "So then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  4:50\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   4:52\n",
      "So I liked that it kept that in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  4:54\n",
      "OK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?\n",
      "\n",

      "P3   5:41\n",
      "I just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  5:48\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   5:48\n",
      "If I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  6:10\n",
      "Hmm. Uh, OK, but.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   6:16\n",
      "So I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  6:42\n",
      "Oh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   6:59\n",
      "Umm. Sorry, let me think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  7:13\n",
      "Yes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   7:24\n",
      "Umm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.\n",
      "I didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.\n",
      "\n",

      "Umm. Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   7:49\n",
      "Otherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.\n",

      "\n",

      "OK Ohh now I remember.\n",
      "OK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  9:00\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "P3   9:27\n",
      "Umm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about.\n",
      "To being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.\n",
      "Umm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  10:05\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",

      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   10:11\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "P3   10:35\n",
      "Umm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  10:45\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "If I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]?\n",
      "Can, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want.\n",
      "So and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   11:18\n",
      "Umm, so could you repeat that question?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  11:23\n",
      "I'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question.\n",
      "You said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want.\n",
      "And was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   11:48\n",
      "Ohh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  12:05\n",
      "Umm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   12:24\n",
      "Umm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  12:45\n",
      "Right. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   12:55\n",
      "Yeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  13:17\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   13:17\n",
      "And I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine.\n",
      "And then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad.\n",
      "It was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  13:38\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   13:38\n",
      "But I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  13:46\n",
      "Umm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   13:59\n",
      "Ohh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out.\n",
      "Could you repeat that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  14:07\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Do you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   14:21\n",
      "Ohm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  14:31\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   14:35\n",
      "But if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  14:44\n",
      "OK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   15:04\n",
      "Ohm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture.\n",
      "I don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  15:39\n",
      "Mm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   15:53\n",
      "Yeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.\n",
      " \n",
      "Kadir  16:02\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   16:02\n",
      "Umm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  16:12\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "It seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human.\n",
      "Uh. Features.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   16:32\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  16:35\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "U], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   16:46\n",
      "Ohm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI.\n",
      "So then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  17:02\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   17:08\n",
      "I don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do.\n",
      "And I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  17:21\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   17:25\n",
      "When it first came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  17:27\n",
      "OK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   17:37\n",
      "Yeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  17:57\n",
      "OK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm.\n",
      "On on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   18:20\n",
      "I feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  18:53\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   18:55\n",
      "I think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very.\n",
      "How do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  19:29\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   19:38\n",
      "So it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  19:46\n",
      "OK, OK.\n",
      "Umm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   20:09\n",
      "Gonna say that hasn't really changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  20:13\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   20:13\n",
      "How are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  20:19\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   20:28\n",
      "It could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  20:40\n",
      "OK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   20:54\n",
      "Umm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  20:59\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   21:04\n",
      "Like if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  21:13\n",
      "Mm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity or difference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   21:43\n",
      "I guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  22:33\n",
      "Umm. Hmm. OK.\n",
      "Umm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with.\n",
      "Umm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your?\n",
      "Prompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:09\n",
      "Oh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  23:12\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:15\n",
      "I felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  23:26\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:31\n",
      "Umm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  23:41\n",
      "So it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:46\n",
      "Umhm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  23:47\n",
      "So you can't make it on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:51\n",
      "Oh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  23:55\n",
      "I don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   23:57\n",
      "Ohh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links.\n",
      "I might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  24:07\n",
      "What?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   24:07\n",
      "It would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  24:28\n",
      "OK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it?\n",
      "Can I quickly ask?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   24:41\n",
      "Oh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  24:44\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Or you said you were watching it, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   24:47\n",
      "Oh, oh, no, no.\n",
      "I was just, uh, I just said Ohh.\n",
      "I think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip and then that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  24:54\n",
      "Yeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements.\n",
      "Also, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very?\n",
      "Generic.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   25:27\n",
      "I think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  25:33\n",
      "Umm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   25:49\n",
      "Well, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  26:02\n",
      "Did you? Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   26:02\n",
      "So I I feel like it's probably 50-50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  26:06\n",
      "Hmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   26:26\n",
      "Umm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists.\n",

      "OK.\n",

      "\n",
      "P3   26:55\n",
      "Yeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:08\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:09\n",

      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:15\n",
      "And it was giving me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:15\n",
      "Or yeah, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:17\n",

      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:19\n",
      "Stores,. You mean?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:20\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:20\n",
      "I just remember, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:22\n",
      "Yeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:35\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   27:35\n",
      "One of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  27:43\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "OK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   28:15\n",
      "Umm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached.\n",
      "I don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  28:41\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "OK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense.\n",
      "Umm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   29:05\n",
      "Ohm.\n",
      "I guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries.\n",
      "Even if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  29:57\n",
      "OK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   29:59\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadir  30:02\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Yeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Thank you very much for attending us.\n",
      "I don't know if should see as a question or not, but.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:15\n",
      "Umm I I have a few more questions.\n",
      "I'll just go ahead and ask your.\n",
      "So do you see just to reel back a little bit?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   30:20\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:25\n",
      "So I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   30:47\n",
      "Ohh yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   30:51\n",
      "And then? You asked it.\n",
      "Hey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right?\n",
      "And then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it.\n",
      "And then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think.\n",
      "And it said, hey, what else is going on?\n",
      "Are there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshots after that?\n",
      "So did you, like, continue the conversation after that?\n",
      "Do you remember anything from that day regarding it?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   31:24\n",
      "Ohh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:42\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   31:43\n",
      "So I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   31:44\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "OK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new?\n",
      "Conversation starters.\n",
      "Uh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it.\n",
      "So how do you feel about that interaction in general?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   32:15\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "I feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm.\n",
      "And when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:51\n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   32:52\n",
      "So it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   32:57\n",
      "Umm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or five different things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for.\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   33:36\n",
      "I want to say it's good for.\n",
      "I mean, I keep bringing this up, but.\n",
      "Since I like food, I like exploring new food places.\n",
      "I like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even?\n",
      "Umm definitely.\n",
      "When I've tried to talk to ChatGPT.\n",
      "Yeah, it's just kind of curves me.\n",
      "It's like, OK, ask me the question now.\n",
      "And even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue.\n",
      "Having a conversation with you as long as you wanted to.\n",
      "Umm. What?\n",
      "It's bad for though.\n",
      "I'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate.\n",
      "If that mean it's even less accurate, there we go.\n",
      "In a lot of a lot of things.\n",
      "So I think that's what it's bad that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   34:46\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "Ohm.\n",
      "So I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left.\n",
      "I guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK.\n",
      "So final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly?\n",
      "\n",
      "P3   35:41\n",
      "I wish there was.\n",
      "I don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.\n",
      "I don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for.\n",
      "It's just.\n",
      "I just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but.\n",
      "Because I I still didn't even know what it was for.\n",
      "Really, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for.\n",
      "Maybe.\n",
      "But even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for.\n",
      "If it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shristi   36:29\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Yeah, makes sense.\n",
      "OK, I think that's all I had.\n",
      "So thank you so much.\n",

      "Transcript P1_Interview March 11, 2024, 7:05PM Shristi 0:07 Ok. OK, so we have started the recording and transcription. I just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself? P1 0:21 Sure. Umm. So my name is [--]. I'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program. This is my second to last semester. Umm before that I'm. I'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years. Decided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer. Shristi 1:02 Umm, thank you. So which social media platforms are using currently? P1 1:10 Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok. Shristi 1:22 And Tiktok. OK umm so. Umm. So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that you’ve been using Snapchat for some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so? P1 1:31 Umm. Shristi 1:38 Do you remember when you started using Snapchat? P1 1:41 Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years since I ﬁrst started using it.And I was deﬁnitely a lot more active on it early on. I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less about it and they stopped posting as much. And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories. Shristi 2:15 Umm. P1 2:20 So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much. And my friends aren't. I don't go it on it too much anymore. I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's nothing. Shristi 2:36 Umm. OK. So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera? P1 2:51 Yeah. So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notiﬁcations from any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like other people's stories. Shristi 3:16 OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family? P1 3:23 I do. It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a while. Shristi 3:30 Yeah, and. P1 3:34 And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot. So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends. Like if I think of them every once in a while.Shristi 3:54 Hmm. OK, makes sense. So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study? P1 4:03 Umm, I actually have not used it. I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my ﬁrst thought was like I really had no interest in trying it. Umm. Shristi 4:20 Yeah. OK. P1 4:21 It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it. Like back when it was ﬁrst released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried it out. Shristi 4:53 Yeah, yeah, of course. Ohm. So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the past few days now. P1 5:06 Umm. Shristi 5:06 Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did, within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI? So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went. P1 5:23 Sure. Shristi 5:27 If you remember it. P1 5:29 Yeah. So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?Shristi 5:35 Yeah, of course. P1 5:37 OK, sure. So the one I remember the most was my ﬁrst time using it. Umm. And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any any city in the US. Shristi 5:56 Umm. P1 6:00 And so for that one. I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me. Shristi 6:07 Umm. P1 6:08 Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good. Shristi 6:16 Mm-hmm. P1 6:16 So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a person because it like has a Avatar. So like I think the ﬁrst thing I said was like, hi, how are you? Shristi 6:28 Umm. P1 6:32 Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any other like faceless AI model. Shristi 6:41 No. P1 6:42 So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that. And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in Indianapolis.And I've noticed that my like conversation. No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back. Well, at ﬁrst I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis, like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts. P1 8:15 Umm. So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super detailed about how it reached those conclusions. Shristi 8:34 Umm. P1 8:35 And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea to recommend to me. Even though the ﬁnal recommendations were good and I also I..I've realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night. So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary. I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was saying, which I was like impressed by. Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also, even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days. Shristi 9:30 Umm. P1 9:45 And I'm like, I don't know about that. Shristi 9:48 Yeah.P1 9:48 And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't give me sources. Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in. Shristi 10:46 Mm-hmm. P1 10:46 And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't think I was talking about the same things anymore. Shristi 10:55 Yeah. P1 10:58 Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like. Shristi 10:59 Umm, you know? P1 11:02 I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip. Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was ﬁne. Shristi 11:14 Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it forgets about it and gives you something else. P1 11:27 Yeah. Shristi 11:28 So yeah, so much for sharing that. So I do think you have touched a little bit on this already, but on a holistic perspective, when you think about your interactions for the entire timeline or beyond that. So, have you ever found a time when you actually found it helpful and thought you could use it in the future as well?P1 11:37 Mm-hmm. Umm. So I think um.. Like even though I thought this like itinerary process was like helpful and that it did better than what I expected. Uh, I know that other like AI models can do better. Shristi 12:24 Umm. P1 12:24 Like I I know I know for a fact that copilot will give me sources on like what it's telling me? And because there are like other models that would do better, I don't know if I would ever use this again. Umm, I would say like the itinerary. Shristi 12:40 Umm. P1 12:43 A recommendation was deﬁnitely like the best interaction that I had with the model throughout the diary study and maybe like the only reason why I would use it again is if, like Copilot doesn't load on my phone and I'm like out and maybe like using the Snapchat is like quicker. Shristi 13:01 Umm. Umm, OK, thank you. So..so among the experiences that you had and maybe you had some..a pre-existing expectations on what the tool would do. So do you have an experience where my AI met your expectations when you were starting the task versus what you got back? P1 13:34 Umm. So from what I remember, I think um. MyAI like typically met my expectation. I like. I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low like..like I just kind of expected to understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for and for the most part I think it did that like almost every time. Shristi 13:55 Hmm hmm. P1 14:06 Umm. Like if I'm asking for itinerary, it would give me an itinerary with stuff to do, and if I'm asking it to recommend me something to buy, it will give me something to buy. But like I think that's where it like stops impressing me. Umm, because like. For example, on like the one where I was asking it like what should I buy? It gave me like 1 real option. Umm. And it was a good option. It's like a like..it recommended me a backpack that I already have and like I love that backpack, but I like, I think to like go above and beyond. It should havelike asked me or it should have given me like multiple options from different brands and like..link me to like reviews. Shristi 14:52 Mm-hmm. P1 14:56 Like from real people or like reasoning why it like it thinks these backpacks are like high quality, it should have given me like like links with thumbnails of these products. Shristi 15:10 Yep. P1 15:11 It did give me links but the links were broken, but at least it took me to like the the company site for like the backpack. So I guess like. For the most part, like I, I am like impressed that like for the most part it does understand what I'm asking for, but like it doesn't do anything more than that. Shristi 15:30 Umm. Given of course. OK, makes sense. So moving on, so how much effort was required in general to use the chatbot? P1 15:46 Umm overall I it it was pretty effortless. Um, I thought that it was generating ideas pretty quickly. Umm. And I felt like I could be a more more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form like very formal prompts because I felt like I was talking to like a person or not a person but just like some entity with a face. And sometimes like it didn't understand exactly what I was getting at, but I would like to clarify for it and then it would help me like it would do it correctly most of the time. Shristi 16:30 Umm OK. P1 16:33 So pretty effortless. Shristi 16:36 OK. So do you think any special skills or needed to use this chatbot well? P1 16:47 Umm. I not skills, but I think like in order for you to have a good time using this chat box or chat bot. Sorry.Shristi 17:00 Umm. P1 17:01 You would need to like calibrate your expectations correctly like I think you need to go into it like having the right expectations. Like if you expected that it would give you like very detailed responses with sources like, you would have for like chat, GPT or copilot, I think you would be sorely disappointed. And if you were talking to it and expecting it to be like a real human, then you might also be disappointed because it's like it's it is kind of human-like but like like I can tell I'm not talking to a human. Shristi 17:42 Umm. P1 17:44 So yeah, I think overall it's just know what it is and don't expect more from it. Shristi 17:52 OK, so did you encounter any speciﬁc obstacles when you were using the tool? P1 18:05 And so some of the links were broken. That's like a I think the bigger obstacles that I can think of. Umm. And that like it gave me recommendations for the wrong city. But overall I..I don't think there's any big ones. Shristi 18:29 Hmm. So when it provided you the wrong recommendations or or provided inadequate responses, did you attempt to resolve the situation and did something else to get the right answers? P1 18:43 Umm, yeah, hold on. I'm my air pods died. Uh. Shristi 18:49 OK. P1 18:52 OK. Can you guys hear me alright? Shristi 18:54 Yeah, we do. P1 18:56Uh, yeah. So whenever it gave me like inadequate recommendations, I would like be more explicit in what I'm asking for. Umm. And I think like for the example where I was asking it for a backpack recommendations I and it didn't give me like links with thumbnails. I also again like. Can you give me links with pictures? So I like know what I'm looking at and actually I think that time it didn't give me any links with pictures, so it was still like kind of failing. But in other times. I think also in that same example I was asking it like can you suggest me like speciﬁc models of backpacks within this brand and like speciﬁc colors. It then gave me speciﬁc models but not speciﬁc colors. Shristi 20:00 Umm. OK. Makes sense. So when you are using it and you run into any problems, so do you think you have access to necessary resources? Maybe a help page, a support page or maybe substantial support from from the application or software to use the speciﬁc feature properly. P1 20:27 Actually no, I like I I wasn't aware that like, maybe there's like a help option. Or that like there's anything on the app that I could go to to understand how to use the tool better. It was pretty much like here's the AI. Now talk to it. Shristi 20:50 OK. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So I'll I'll move a little bit further and ask you so have you ever heard anybody else talk about this feature? It might be a friend, acquaintance or media outlet. I think you did say you saw some things, I think maybe on the social media, others talking about it. P1 21:12 Umm. Shristi 21:14 So can you tell us a few examples of what you had heard? P1 21:18 Yeah. So I think a lot of people. A lot of people thought of this AI model as like a human entity, umm, and they. And because of that, they would ask it questions that, like you would ask like other humans and like, try to be funny about it or like, try to joke with it. Shristi 21:48 Umm. P1 21:48 Uh, or like banter with it? And a lot of times the chatbot like.doesn't want to entertain those sort of conversations.So like. I don't remember. I..I remember one speciﬁcally, someone on. Like the Internet, I think I saw it on Twitter. Someone said something like mildly inappropriate to the chat box, and like the chat bot was like. Hey, now you're being inappropriate. I'm gonna put you in time out. Shristi 22:32 Oh really? P1 22:33 Yeah, it's like, OK, I'm gonna stop talking to you for the next 10 minutes. Um and I..I thought it was funny. Umm. Shristi 22:43 Umm. P1 22:46 Umm. And yeah, I think I I've also heard of my friends try to say things to it. That's like maybe like slightly inappropriate or like things that like you wouldn't logically expect a cha bot to be able to answer. Like I think they were just trying to, like, tease it and they would get like the same sort of like awkward answers. Shristi 23:07 Yeah. P1 23:11 Like I don't know what you're talking about or like. I don't like talking about this. Please stop talking to me for the next 10 minutes. Like, sort that sort of thing. Shristi 23:21 Yeah. P1 23:23 So yeah, I think that's all the everything I've heard about from other people. Shristi 23:28 OK, so so have there been any sources or maybe somebody you know or is something that has been posted on the Internet that kind of made you curious to try it or use it? P1 23:43 Umm, I would say no. Because all the situations online the I saw were usually like uncomfortable situations or like awkward interactions that are funny. But it's like it's not interactions that I personally wanna spend time like doing. Shristi 24:10Makes sense. Ohm so. So if if you were to make a recommendation to your own friends, or maybe family or any person that you know, would you recommend this chatbot to anyone? P1 24:26 Umm. I'm pretty. Ohm on. I..I don't think I would actually recommend it to anyone for like a real purpose. Umm. Like umm. I think. Yeah, because like I know there are other models who do the same things better. And so I would rather recommend my friends to use a better model, but I might say like. Uh. What am I trying to say? I guess it's like it's. A lot of like, maybe a lot of things I've been seeing on social media are people trying to, like, break this chatbot like they're trying to, like, say, like, really outlandish things to it, to, like, break it and then get, like, a funny interaction out of it. Shristi 25:28 Umm. P1 25:36 So like I might like to suggest it to my friend, like I don't think it's used forever. Shristi 25:36 Umm. P1 25:41 Anything but it might say something funny back to you that that's all. Shristi 25:45 Yeah, makes sense. P1 25:49 Yeah. Shristi 25:50 So have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since you started using MyAI? P1 26:04 No, I I don't think so. Shristi 26:07 Hmm, OK. So have you used or are you currently using something that's similar to MyAI? P1 26:21 I think the closest thing is probably ChatGPT.Shristi 26:27 Umm so so. P1 26:28 Which is just, yeah. Shristi 26:30 Hmm. So, so so when so when you are using chat GPT. So do you also use others? Gemini, Copilot? Do you also use other chatbots in search engines? P1 26:49 Umm. I have used copilot once. I think overall because like I'm used to ChatGPT, I'm less likely to to use like to try out other models. Also, because like I know that a lot of AI models are still like in the very early stages and I don't know if I should like trust a lot of them like for Gemini for example. Shristi 27:20 Mm-hmm. Umm. P1 27:29 Like I know that they've been controversial lately because of some of the things that they've been generating. Umm. So like when I'm constantly like hearing news about, you know, this new AI model is generating inappropriate things, and then this AI model is saying these things that are not factual and stuff. It makes me like less likely to wanna try it out and I guess at least with chat GPT like I think I..I have it like established like. Rapport with it already from using it so much so I feel more comfortable with just sticking with that one, but eventually I think I will try others. Shristi 28:21 Umm. Umm yeah, sure. So do you think there are any similarities between MyAI and chat GPT in in terms of the experience or interactions that you have? P1 28:40 I'm yeah, I think so. I think umm. Umm. I think like the formatting of answers or similar like they, umm like both models. Make sure that, like the answers are really scannable and I can expect to follow like a certain structure. Uh. Of like, you know, like bullet point, bullet point, umm and like be able to just kind of read only what I need. And I..I think both are also like somewhat. Impersonal sounding if I'm not speciﬁcally asking likethe Snapchat AI to like like if I'm not asking a personal question. Umm. Then the answer I'm getting is very like machine-like. Shristi 29:51 Umm. OK. Makes sense. Umm. So if you compare ChatGPT and MyAI again, So what do you think are some story game differences you see on both of those things? P1 30:08 Umm, I think the the biggest difference I noticed is that I don't think of chat GPT as like an entity with. With a face or like any like human human traits at all, like it's I cannot think of it as like this. Shristi 30:22 Umm. P1 30:31 Like Ohh knowing like machine somewhere. Shristi 30:35 Umm. P1 30:36 Where it's like. I think of MyjAI more as like an entity just because like when I talk to it, it's always in a message format and it has a face. But like outside of like the presentation, it doesn't feel much different. Shristi 31:06 Yeah, I think that's that's fair. So when you were interacting with MyAI, did you get responses that had sponsored content by any chance - sponsored content, ads? P1 31:19 Umm. Ohh no, I don't think so. Shristi 31:28 Ohh OK really OK. P1 31:30 Yeah. Shristi 31:32 Umm, so uh, so I think I I wanna know a little bit more about you know MyAI responding backand giving you recommendations about restaurants and Austin. So it kind of knew you were in Austin at least. P1 31:48 Yeah. Shristi 31:49 And you said that, hey, I'm in Austin while talking to it. So. So I don't know if you remember it or not, but do you have your location data turned on Snapchat? P1 32:02 Yeah, my location data is turned on and I don't think I ever told it that I live in Austin. Shristi 32:10 OK. Yeah. P1 32:11 Yeah. Shristi 32:11 So maybe then if your location is maybe turned on, then it directly directed directed. P1 32:15 It just knows, yeah. Shristi 32:17 Yeah, it knows and then it just gave you recommendations based on that then. OK, so so when you receive any recommendations. So for example, you were trying to search for something actually trying to search for something in your location. So how do you feel about the AI constantly tracking your location and giving you recommendations based on that? P1 32:42 Umm, so I think like I expected that. Like I sort of expected it to know everything that I have given like the Snapchat platform by myself. So it didn't make me feel any particular way. Shristi 33:06 OK, makes sense. P1 33:08 Uh, sorry to interject. I actually like because you you were saying like recommendations. I remember like maybe a bigger a big difference I noticed between ChatGPT and Snapchat is like chat. GPT actually saves all of my prompts that I gave to it, and it like lists all the prompts on like the sidebar and select.Shristi 33:29 Mm-hmm. P1 33:33 It almost encourages me to go back to these prompts and see like reference back to like what I asked before and maybe like ask follow up questions or like ask better Prompts whereas like I think in MyAI. I don't remember if it deletes my answers or not. Shristi 33:45 Umm. Umm yeah, we think it deletes everything after you ﬁnish the conversation. P1 33:53 I think there was one [inaudible]. Yeah. So it just like deletes everything, which makes me feel like maybe the response is that it gave me. Isn't that like? Isn't that like? um..Important if it's just gonna disappear like that. Shristi 34:11 Hmm. OK. So umm, so I think it was so moving on, I think it was interesting to see you know the game, the game interaction that you have with it. I think I think that was the interaction where you were like umm, I think you you did not have much of a positive experience to what I know from your diary study entry. P1 34:42 Uh, yeah. Shristi 34:42 Ohh can you reiterate like what you felt when you were, you know, like asking you to play a game? Can you like maybe reﬂect back on that experience a little bit for us? P1 34:53 Yeah. OK. Yeah, I remember this really well because I was like, annoyed at it. I was asking the the AI like let's play a game of what you rather and then it was like. It gave me something lame at 1st and I was like, no, no, give me a better one. And so it gave me A would you rather would you rather be invisible or people to ﬂy? Shristi 35:15 This is. P1 35:20 And I remember answering uh, I would like to be invisible. So I could go rob the bank. Like this is a joke like like anyone can tell, this is a joke. Shristi 35:27 Umm. Yeah.P1 35:32 And then it was giving me this whole like like parent parental response. That's like ohh, you know, it's great to have an imagination and all, but please do not use your imagination about breaking the law or doing things that can harm other people. And I was like. Got. Damn it. Like this is so uh and I was like, it was a joke. You ever used your imaginations for jokes? And then it was like, yeah, I do all the time, actually. And I was like and never talking to this thing again, like or like, making a joke at it. Shristi 36:11 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of counter intuitive when you try to have a joke and it takes it too seriously. P1 36:22 Yeah. Shristi 36:24 Yeah, that's interesting. So so I also remember that you tried to use the AI for, I think recommending you ﬁlters. P1 36:34 Ohh yeah. Shristi 36:34 Ohm, I'm so. So can you like go back a little bit on that day and reiterate your experience with us? P1 36:42 Yeah, I think the prompt was like send send it a photo and ask it to like. Analyze a photo and then there was another prompt that was like. P1 36:56 Ask it to recommend a ﬁlter, so like I tried to combine the two by giving it a picture of my cats and ﬁrst of all it said at the beginning like ohh I'm not allowed to analyze your photos and then it did anyway. Shristi 37:00 Umm. Umm. P1 37:11 So I don't know what that was about. Shristi 37:15 OK.P1 37:16 But yeah, it was like ohh cute cat that you have and I was like thanks. Can you recommend me a ﬁlter to make me look like a cat and then it gave me a link. It was like here use this link and then from from like the the preview of the link. I could tell it's like some kind of cat ﬁlter, but when I click on the link it ended taking me to like the the like the ﬁlter homepage. Shristi 37:45 Umm. P1 37:47 Of the camera like tab. Shristi 37:49 The where we where we take, where we take new snaps. P1 37:53 Yeah. Like when, where you take new slots, snaps and you just like swipe. I think 1 to the right and then you get all the ﬁlters. Shristi 38:00 Umm. P1 38:00 It was just taking me there, like it wasn't taking me to that speciﬁc cat ﬁlter. Shristi 38:04 That OK. Umm, so. So when you were not able to reach the speciﬁc ﬁlter, how how did it make you feel at the time? P1 38:19 You know, maybe like if this was like the beginning of the study, I would have asked it like ohh no, no, give me, give me the right link to this ﬁlter. This is not the right link, but because I had problems with links from Snapchat AI in the past I was just like it's whatever, yeah. Shristi 38:45 Yeah, since I think you've already tried doing that during our shopping task, right. P1 38:49 Yeah. Mm-hmm. Shristi 38:51 OK. Yeah, makes sense. OK.So yeah, moving on a little bit.So I think I have a basic idea for this question based on what you've already said, but again, to be more speciﬁc I'm asking this question again. So how reliable do you ﬁnd the responses by MyAI? P1 39:17 Yeah. So I'm I'm wondering what like reliable means? Like do you mean like factual? Shristi 39:24 Yeah. In terms of how how usable those information are, do you trust the responses enough to maybe maybe it's not everything that you wanted, but maybe you wanna build on that knowledge and doing other things. Do you trust its content or recommendations that it makes? P1 39:45 Yeah. So from like the very limited use the I have, uh, like the I've only used it like four times. So maybe like I would want to like try it a couple more times, but I think at this point I I feel like I could trust it as a jumping off point. Uh, so for example, for the itinerary activity, I would use the things that the IT recommend and like I would Google those places to like do a little more research on my own to see if those places are like places I actually want to go to. Shristi 40:11 Umm. P1 40:31 But I wouldn't take it at face value. Shristi 40:38 Yeah, right. P1 40:40 And like, I wouldn't even trust it to like. Umm. Like, I wouldn't even trust like some of those places to be like, realistic for me to go to. Like I would think like, oh, that's the AI know how far these places are from each other? Shristi 41:01 Umm. P1 41:01 Uh. Or like from the city of Indianapolis, like, does it take those like nuances into account? Does it know how expensive it is? Shristi 41:09 Umm. P1 41:11 Does it even know that those places these places are open, like right now in the winter?Shristi 41:15 Yeah. P1 41:16 It's like for like minute details. I I would do that research on my own. Shristi 41:23 Hmm. OK, so maybe you want to use it just as like a starting off point to give you like maybe ideas about where you could start with. P1 41:34 Basically, yeah. Shristi 41:35 Yeah. OK, fair enough. Umm, so so you. So again, in your interactions, I think you have shared some personal things with AI. For example, your cat picture, or you might have shared something else that we are not aware of. So are there any concerns that you have regarding the information that you share with it? Umm do you have any concerns related to those? P1 42:11 Yeah. You know, I feel like I am a little concerned of sending it some photos of myself, but I feel like these concerns are like unfounded because at the same time. I'm I've already made peace that like this Snapchat model knows all the photos that I've taken on Snapchat in the last seven years. So why am I worried about sending it another photo of myself? Shristi 42:37 I mean. P1 42:41 So I feel like my concern doesn't make sense, but like it's still there I guess, which is why I slanted a photo of my cats instead of myself. Shristi 42:52 Umm yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, uh, those where I think pretty much the questions that we wanted to go to. So, so overall, reﬂecting on the experience is, do you have anything that you wanna talk about that you think we missed asking for? P1 43:16 Umm, no, I thought the questions got me to like present my thoughts pretty comprehensively. Um and like overall, even though like I don't think I'll use this again or like umm, even though I didn't get like some of the best responses from it, I'm really glad I tried umm and I'm kind of really curious about how it will like evolve in the future, like potentially they might be able to ﬁgure out, umm like some better use cases for it. Or they give the AI more personality orsomething to make it like more unique compared to other models. So overall, I'm optimistic for the future. Shristi 44:02 OK. Yeah. Thank you so much. OK, so since we are done and. Kadir 44:05 I have a quick question. I have a quick question. P1 44:09 Yeah. Kadir 44:09 Just before ﬁnishing up just you said compared to ChatGPT it gives more human like traits or feelings as if you are talking to an entity with face and then does this kind of relate. P1 44:24 Umm. Kadir 44:27 I mean, how does this lead to a different sorts of prompting. I mean, do you use different prompts for chat, GPT? Or how does that work on your side? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out in fact does this difference in terms of seeing it as an entity or as a more personal entity versus ChatGPT more maybe. More mission like let's say, can you little bit elaborate on that? P1 44:54 Yeah. So for the Snapchat AI, I feel more compelled to like greet it. So like I I'm more compelled to say hello. How are you? And then like at the end, the conversation I'm more likely to say goodbye like I know it makes no difference. Kadir 45:13 Umm. P1 45:13 Probably, but like I'm compelled to want to build rapport with it. Like how I would a human. And. I'm also like compelled to be more casual in my speech to it, and like perhaps I'm even. Kadir 45:29 Hmm. P1 45:32 Umm, less likely to take it seriously because it sounds like a human. Or like my expectation is that it's like a human and so like. Potentially like if I must ask an AI like a important question about like the trajectory of my life, I wouldn't even think about doing that with like the SnapchatAI, and partly because I feel like it's like a entity. Like, I would rather ask like an all knowing like faceless machine like ChatGPT. Kadir 46:06 Umm. Shristi 46:12 No. Yeah. Kadir 46:14 Hmm. Hmm, yeah. Shristi 46:17 Me, I think I would like to move a little bit on that. So. So for for speciﬁcally for Snapchat AI, if you ever you know like use it again or if feel like using it. So I think what what purposes do you think that my AI would be more suitable for? P1 46:37 Umm, I think. Umm. I think it's a lot more suitable for like entertainment. Like. Uh, like those, like games that you've mentioned? Shristi 47:01 Umm. P1 47:01 I'm wondering if I would have had a better time if I had picked like any of the other games. Like maybe I could ask me really good trivia and I never knew because I never tried it. Shristi 47:09 Umm. P1 47:11 Umm. And it would be, I thought, I think it would be fun if it can, like, get some of those games. Right. And like, put more like human like elements or like make like better jokes or. Shristi 47:28 Umm. P1 47:30 If it seemed like more like vulnerable, I guess. Then like. Umm. Like, because like the, the response is a gave me when I was trying to play games with it with it was like sort of like a corporate like liability response. Like do not use this to think about things that will break the law and that just took me out of the my experience completely because I'm aware that I'm talking to a company.Shristi 47:49 Umm. P1 47:59 So somehow like well, maintaining like liability and all that if they can, like, be more human like and more be more entertaining, I think that'll be uh uh cool use case. Kadir 48:07 Umm. So I was gonna in fact come bring the conversation here. Shristi 48:14 Umm. Kadir 48:17 That's very timely. Umm, you're you're you're seeing it more entertainment purpose, maybe for less serious business, let's say. And then from more like a personal entity, probably you have a different as you said response or expect kind of like kind of thought. But when you see those things, then it seems, how does? How do you feel in, in terms of your feelings? Can you a little bit more elaborate on that? P1 48:47 Uh, could you say that again? So like uh? Kadir 48:51 Sure, it seems you know you are maybe seeing my AI at a more personal level, let's say, like a maybe not long, not a friend, but at least compared to other AI models. And then for more entertainment purposes for maybe less serious things just to casual and then in response to this, for sure you are expecting that maybe, I don't know, maybe tone maybe, umm, responses which are more maybe less serious or at least closer to human beings. P1 49:09 Yes. Kadir 49:26 As far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong. P1 49:27 Yes. Kadir 49:29 And how does this affect you as a user? A little bit more if you have. I mean does it, I mean what are your feelings at that time when you start a conversation and then when you don't get the kind of responses you you get from the MyAI? P1 49:49Yeah. So in those situations I felt like I had like, the wrong expectations for it. Like when I was expecting it to act more like a human and it like starts talking to me like a company or like like a more like a machine. Kadir 50:07 Mm-hmm. P1 50:08 That's where I'm sort of like dialing back on my expectations. Kadir 50:13 Umm. P1 50:15 And I'm like ohh what? What am I expecting like this is like I guess like. It made me like less invested to like use it, I guess because I'm like, well, the only thing it had going for it was like it maybe was gonna be more conversational and more. Kadir 50:29 Umm. P1 50:40 Or, uh, like like human? Like so. Kadir 50:46 Umm. P1 50:46 Like if it doesn't even meet those expectations, then I don't know. Like why I would use this over like chat, GPT or copilot or other like programs who I know will give me more accurate answers. Kadir 50:54 Umm. Yeah. Thanks very much. P1 51:07 Yeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Woah you're muted. Kadir 51:13 Ohh wait, you're you're muted. Shristi 51:16 I do it all the time. I'm sorry.P1 51:18 Yeah, yeah. Shristi 51:19 So yeah, thank you so much for being in the interview. Uh, as you can close out, I'll ask you again. Is there anything that you would like to mention? P1 51:30 No, I think you guys cover everything and it was really fun. Thanks for inviting me to participate. Shristi 51:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Kadir 51:37 Deﬁnitely. Shristi 51:37 Yeah, I know it was a long time. So yeah, I really appreciate your participation. OK Shristi stopped transcription\n",

      "   - **Description**: Users often approach MyAI with a conversational tone, treating it more like a friend or casual acquaintance rather than a formal AI tool. This is evident in how they greet the AI and how they express their prompts casually. For instance, P1 mentioned that they felt compelled to greet MyAI and engage in a friendly manner, which contrasts with their interactions with other AI models like ChatGPT, which they perceive as more formal and machine-like.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P1 stated, \"I felt like I could be more casual with, like talking to it. Like I didn't have to like form very formal prompts.\"\n",

      "   - **Description**: Users often have low expectations for MyAI, which influences their satisfaction with the responses. Many participants indicated that while MyAI met their basic expectations for generating responses, it often fell short in providing detailed or accurate information. This theme includes the realization that MyAI's capabilities are limited compared to other AI tools.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P1 expressed that their expectations were low, stating, \"I do wanna preface by saying that my expectation for it is pretty low... it did understand what I'm asking and give me what I'm asking for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Usefulness and Practicality**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Users reported mixed feelings about the usefulness of MyAI. While some found it helpful for generating ideas or suggestions (e.g., travel itineraries), others felt it lacked depth and reliability. The AI was sometimes seen as a starting point for ideas rather than a definitive source of information.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P3 rated MyAI a 2.5 out of 5, indicating that while it provided some useful suggestions, it was often vague and not as reliable as other AI tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Limitations and Frustrations**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Participants highlighted several limitations of MyAI, including vague responses, broken links, and inaccuracies in recommendations. Users expressed frustration when the AI failed to provide the expected level of detail or when it misunderstood their queries.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P3 mentioned, \"If I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one,\" indicating a struggle with the AI's responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Entertainment vs. Serious Use**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Many users viewed MyAI as more suitable for entertainment purposes rather than serious inquiries. They appreciated its playful nature and the ability to engage in casual games or conversations but recognized its limitations for more serious tasks.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 6. **Concerns About Privacy and Data Usage**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Users expressed concerns about privacy and how their data might be used by Snapchat or MyAI. Despite their awareness of potential data tracking, some participants felt resigned to the fact that their information was likely being collected.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P3 noted, \"I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it just because I don't know if... the data would get breached.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Comparative Analysis with Other AI Tools**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Participants frequently compared MyAI to other AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. They noted that while MyAI had a more casual interface, it lacked the depth and reliability of these other tools. Users preferred ChatGPT for more serious inquiries and tasks.\n",
      "   - **Example**: P3 stated, \"If they're looking to have a conversation with a bot, they could use the MyAI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI.\"\n",
