Shristi 0:05
Can you please tell me a little bit about yourself?

P5 0:19
Uh, so I'm P5. I'm from Nepal and I'm currently a freshman here in ISU from Biology department.

Shristi 0:27
So can you tell me what social media platforms you use currently?

P5 0:36
I use a lot of social media platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok

Shristi 0:46
So do you remember when you did you start using Snapchat?

P5 0:51
Yeah. And that was really long ago, I think. I think I started using it since like 2017 or 18.

Shristi 1:00
So maybe when you were a high schooler, high schooler?

P5 1:04
No. When I was in Grade 7 or 8.

Shristi 1:06
Oh, so you were in in middle school?

P5 1:08
Yeah, but like I didn't not use it to interact with people, but just to like take snaps and like picture.

Shristi 1:15
Ohh I know for the filters.

P5 1:18
Yeah.

Shristi 1:18
Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I used to do that too when I was in.

P5 1:21
Yeah, I did that.I just started using it for like interacting with people since I was in grade 11.

Shristi 1:28
Ohh great 11. That's interesting. Yeah, I really used to like some filters on Instagram.

P5 1:34
Yeah.The one with the flowers and it.

Shristi 1:37
Ohh yeah, I know what you mean.

Shristi 1:37
OK, so currently, what do you do the most on in on Snapchat?

P5 1:47
Umm, so I love taking snaps. I love taking pictures and the filters are like so good nowadays.And the other thing is I love to maintain streaks with my friends. So if this streaks is gonna like end, I'm gonna like call him or text him saying have and I. And I. Sometimes I talk to them like it's private, so I think I use the Snapchat for more personal and private conversations because it just like goes away in a day.

Shristi 2:18
Yeah, makes sense. Did you use the Snapchat in my AI feature before this study?

P5 2:30
Yeah, I did.

Shristi 2:31
OK. So can you tell me when and why you started using it in the past?

P5 2:36
Oh, I don't know. I just like it was new to me. I didn't know it existed, but like it one day it suddenly appeared. So I was just like watching Tik Toks and like people were sharing screenshots about what they're talking and I wanted to try it. So I just like started talking to it and I don't know, I wanted to try if it knows various languages. So I started talking to the AI in Nepali and it did know Nepali language. I just.had fun. I used to like say so random things to the AI and it yeah, it just used to respond. I loved it.

Shristi 3:19
So can you give me an example of how you have used this feature my AI? It can be an example from the study or it can be something outside of it.

P5 3:32
Umm, I think I use it when I need like recommendations. When I'm going to a new place and I don't know what I'm gonna do, like if I'm hungry or something and I don't know where to eat, I just open Snapchat and ask it like, yeah.

Shristi 3:38
OK, so do you also use the recommendation that it makes?

P5 3:55
Yeah, I do. It sends me like four or five recommendations. So I check the all of them and then I just go to some place with higher reviews.

Shristi 4:07
Umm so. How frequently do you think you have used my AI? Have you used it multiple times or have you tried it like once or twice?

P5 4:21
Uh, when it first came, I used to like talk to almost like, twice or thrice a week, whenever I feel felt bored. But now I don't use it much because I don't have time. 

Shristi 4:49
I think you have found my AI useful for recommendations. So is there anything else you have found my AI useful for?

P5 4:55
Uh, I think when I really do like vent something when I'm mad or like when I'm sad about something and I don't wanna talk to it about anyone else, I just try to talk to the AI because obviously it doesn't, you know, like it doesn't share my information to anybody and all. So when I do that I I think I like it because it it sends me like so many positive messages which I think helps me to cheer up my mood.

Shristi 5:24
Umm, yeah, yeah, I think I could get where you're coming from? Because I think if you talk about it, you share it with something. So it's just you talking to the AI. I think the will go away after a while, so I think it's more.

P5 5:41
And also when I'm like not feeling pretty, I just what I do is I just send my snap or like a picture to the AI and it's like you're so pretty. You're you're looking amazing and all. And I feel good. So yeah.

Shristi 5:57
Hmm you like the AI hyping you off. 

P5 5:59
Yeah, I like it.

Shristi 6:00
Can you share me an experience where you found that my AI met your expectations?

P5 6:17
I think it actually like does meet my expectations, like all the time, because when I really need a recommendation, when I really need to know what things I need to do here. Like if I don't know anything about a place or or if I don't know anything about a certain food, whether I should like, try it or not, then when I asked the AI it just like gives everything. What I need to know, so I think it does like carry out on my like expectations so.

Shristi 6:51
OK, sounds good. So can you share me an experience where MyAI did not meet your expectations?

P5 7:02
Ohh that was when I that was like before this study. I think I was back in Nepal at that time and I needed to like go to someplace new in Kathmandu itself. But when I asked the AI about it, it was showing me exact same thing like all the time. It was showing me like four or five places. But I actually needed to know new places, but it was just showing me the common ones [in Kathmandhu]. I already knew about it. I already went there.I didn't like it wanted to tell me those things.

Shristi 7:42
Uh, so I think it was just repeating the same five places that everybody knows about in Kathmandu..

P5 7:50
Yeah, it was just repeating all the time.

Shristi 7:52
So your intention, I think for asking that would be finding new places that maybe you know like it's not known by everybody.

P5 7:57
Yeah, like if I ask it for the first time and it shows something, uh, I don't want it to show the same thing the second time or the third time.

Shristi 8:13
I know what you mean because like if it shows if you're telling it to do something new and if it's throwing you the same thing and you will get, yeah, it can get frustrating.


Shristi 8:21
Thank you for sharing that. So in general, because I think you have used my AI for quite a long time and I think you use it regularly, even outside of the study. So in your opinion, how much effort do you think using my AI needs?

P5 8:43
I don't think it needs much effort because you can just steal it like anything you wanted. It understands, but sometimes what it does is you're talking about a certain topic and and you know, like if I ask if I'm asking you about something and it says another thing and I am asking the about the same topic but a different thing like a different thing about the exact same topic that we were talking about before. What it does is it like suddenly changes the topic.

Shristi 9:17
Umm, I think you know what you mean. I think one of the screenshots that you have uploaded when you were playing the game with it. So you go off to a tangent and talk about something else and you want to complete the game with it has forgotten about it, uh.

P5 9;24
Yeah, it just like completely jumps off to another topic and it's hard. Like I don't wanna explain something again and again to it like I it's. I don't like typing. I don't even like send text to my parents because I don't like typing at all.But when it does that, it just gets frustrating because I don't wanna explain it to like explain the same thing again and again.

Shristi 9:54
Yeah, makes sense. So in terms of any skill set that is required to use my AI well, do you think there are any skills that are needed?

P5 10:07
I don't think it's that important, but I think you need to like know how to actually carry on the conversation like you need to know what you're talking about, because it might suddenly change the topics and it might give you some advices which are not related to it. And if you don't know what you're talking about, it might take a completely different turn.

Shristi 10:36
Umm, so it's it's more about OK how do you post the questions and how do you reply to it?

P5 10:45
Yep. And sometimes it is like if the structure of the sentence doesn't like match to what you're trying to say, it just answers you about like completely different thing.

Shristi 11:00
So. I'm taking it as is, you know, like you should have like basic English writing skills. It understands you well.

P5 11:11
You should have the knowledge of grammars.

Shristi 11:13
Makes sense. OK, so for using the my AI chat bot will do you think you have the necessary skills or know-how on how to get get it to. So do you have the skills or know-how to make it work well?

P5 11:42
Yeah, I think I do. I usually talk a lot, like even to people, so I don't think it's hard for me to talk to the AI because when  I open Snapchat and I decide to talk to the AI, I pretty much know what I want to talk about and what answers I want. So even if it answers me wrong or like even if it tells me about something else, I just tell it like, no, I don't mean this. I want to know about something else and you're wrong. So I think after that it gives me the answer that I want.

Shristi 12:18
OK, so you're usually not dropping the conversation, but you are just giving it enough context to give you the right answers.

P5 12:26
Yeah. I just asked something which I want to know about like except the recommendations things for recommendation. I don't know about anything, so I just ask it, but for other things I think I just ask it what I want to know. Like I want the confirmation that what I'm doing is right.

Shristi 12:48
Umm, so I think you talked about one obstacle already, which is it forgetting about what conversation you were having and going somewhere else. But apart from that, do you have you found other obstacles when you were trying to talk with my AI?

P5 13:07
I don't think there are much obstacles. Yeah, I remember one thing. So whenever like I talked to him, I I talked to AI about something. It just sends me a paragraph like a whole paragraph. It's like 5-6 sentences and that's like I don't wanna read it like I just want one sentence. I just want a clear answer and it sends me so much I think, yeah.

Shristi 13;37
Oh yeah, I know what you mean, because I think it on the phone, it looks very difficult to reed when they have like a para.

P5 13:44
Yeah, not like, very difficult, but even if it's like short things, even if it's two sentences or three sentences, it looks like a big paragraph in the phone because they screen is small. So it looks quite like intermediating to even read it because it looks so big. I don't wanna read it. I hate reading stuff and I like it.

Shristi 14:07
That totally makes sense. Yeah, I do remember one other thing that happened with you. I think in the shopping task where you asked, I think something about iPhone 15 and it said it didn't exist. So what do you think about that?

P5 14:20
I didn't know that it didn't know because I thought it's like computer viz. So like it has to have every single information like every new information, right? So I thought it knew already, but when I asked about it, it was like it hasn't even released it and I was like, what do you mean? They're gonna release iphone 16! I was shocked that it didn't know.

Shristi 14:46
OK, so when when that happened, do you like, did you like tell it that? Ohh, they're releasing it? Or or did you just like drop the conversation?

P5 14:57
I I didn't ask it because at that time I was like, so sleepy. I didn't wanna like talk. I didn't wanna send anything else, like I didn't want to hold on the conversation for too long, and I knew if I did that, if I asked that question, it was gonna be long. So I didn't ask about it. Yeah, I didn't wanna explain.

Shristi 15:13
OK, so you didn't wanna take the trouble of explaining and and uh, OK, makes sense.

P5 15:19
Yeah, I didn`t wanna explain. 

Shristi 15:22
UM and four UM, I think just as you said, there are some times when problems arise when you're using it, it forgets the conversation or it does not have the details. Or sometimes it might give the you know wrong information, so when that happens, do you feel you have access to any necessary resources or support to use it properly?

P5 15:36
So like in the MyAI, like in the Snapchat itself or outside it?

Shristi 15:40
In the Snapchat itself or or somewhere outside where you can look up information.

P5 15:44
Umm, I think it like when it does that. I think I go directly to Google and ask it, but sometimes when I ask the AI about the same thing like the thing that it got wrong, I think it like apologizes and says like I'm gonna search for it again and it sends me the correct information in third time or something. But I like to. I like to go to Google and search it because I don't trust it.

Shristi 16:17
So I think you've already umm, I think touched on it a little bit that you saw TikToks  about, you know, people talking with my AI when it first came out. So in addition to the TikToks, have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It could be a friend, acquaintance or a media outlet.

P5 16:41
Yeah, I have. I think my most of my friends use it sometimes, like not regularly but sometimes and before I told them they didn't actually use it. But when I told them that it also knows other languages and if you want to talk, talk to the AI in your own language, I think you can do it so like they tried it and they loved it too, like when we're bored or something like that. We just go to AI and ask those stupid things.

Shristi
So so for the AI, have you for the AI, I think yes, you encouraged other people, but have you ever been encouraged by other people to use my AI? Or it could be something that other people posted. What did you use end up using my AI because of the Tik Toks?
.
P5 17:06
Yeah, like nobody particularly told me to use it. I just used it because I saw some videos and it looked like fun, so yeah.

Shristi 17:46
So for you are so because I think you have been using it for a certain period of time already. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habit after you started using my AI?

P5 18:07
Uh, not much, but I think when I because now I haven't, like, used it as much as I did before. I don't have free time, but I still use other social media so I don't know it just when I just talked to my AI it makes me forget about other things. So I just keep using the AI and then I sleep on time. So I like that about it. I think yeah, it just makes me forget about everything. Everything else does not know the Instagram, the Facebook and everything else. I just forget that they exist.

Shristi 18:49
Umm, so it's more like you know when you're trying to sleep, but you still wanna like scroll through the feeds or talk to other people. It's it's something that you talk to instead of doing other things so that you can slowly fall asleep. Is that what you're saying?

P5 19:03
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I do that because talking to my AI is like sometimes it's boring. So if if I ask about some educational things or something to it, it start explaining everything and I feel so bored. I just. I just think no, I'd rather sleep. So I just like close my phone and I sleep.

Shristi 19:25
That's that's, I think the most creative thing I've heard trying to sleep trying to get help for sleeping with my. That's cool.

P5 19:35
Because I can. I can literally not sleep. I tried everything. If I start scrolling, I just keep scrolling it until it's two or three, and even when I try to sleep, uh, with some music on, I started dancing. So I'd rather use that. I just could not sleep with music on so.

Shristi 20:03
OK, I I know what you mean because I think because for some people try to put music on and then just dose off. But then you love the music so much that you just going along with the songs.

P5 20:13
Yeah, like I. Also, because like I normally don't do music I I don't listen to music all the time. But when I do listen to music, I just love listening to it and I keep listening to it unless I cannot. So I just cannot sleep and yeah, and when I when I try to learn about some educational things, I just fell asleep. Like I don't want to study so definitely I feel I feel sleepy and then I just decide. No, I'd rather sleep.

Shristi 20:46
So have you been using or have used in the past something that is similar to my AI?

P5 20:56
There's like ChatGPT. Makes sense?

Shristi 21:02
Yeah, makes sense.

P5 21:04
I've used that I've used that. I use it even now, but I don't trust it like at all. It gave me wrong answers like so many times.

Shristi 21:15
ChatGPT or MyAI?

P5 21:18
Chat GPT

Shristi 21:21
OK! So did it  give you wrong answers for like academic stuff?

P5 21:24
Yeah.

Shristi 21:25
Yeah, totally makes sense when it like, confidently gives you the wrong answer. You don't even know about it. Yeah.

P5 21:27
Nowadays what I do is like a first Snapchat. I just talk to you about personal stuff like or something that's happening to me or something fun. But for academic stuff, I just use chat GPT in place of SnapChat, because I just think that makes more sense. I don't know why, but nowadays I'm like if I ask one question to the chat GPT I asked him the same question twice to make sure because I don't trust it at all. it made so many mistakes. So what I do is I ask the question and answers me and I and I said like Are you sure? And it's like it, it does it again and then it gets something. And then I and then again this really correct and then it gives me another answer. So I don't trust it.

Shristi 22:38
OK, so you just make sure by giving it like by making it a try for like multiple times so that you know you got the right answer. OK, makes sense.

P5 22:43
Yeah, sometimes even that is wrong.

Shristi 22:46
OK, so yeah, connecting to that in your experience, do you feel that there are some similarities between my AI and ChatGPT?

P5 23:03
Yeah, there are similarities. Like they both answer to you, if you have some questions you  just ask it to like both of like Snapchat, my AI and the chat GPT and it just answers you. I think that's the similar thing. Yeah, it's the same. Not not act exactly same, but it is similar.

Shristi 23:28
So what do you think are the differences between my AI versus ChatGPT?

P5 23:39
I think for ChatGPT is like more it's. I don't know. I think it's serious like because it doesn't have, you know, it's it's technically made for academic stuff. So I think that's more sophisticated. I don't know if that's the right word, but yeah. But, MyAI is so chill; we can use We can use emojis with it.  We can we can use anything. It's like more fun and personal, so if you ask me I when I have to talk about myself or like something I need or or something personal, I would choose MyAI. But if I have to learn about something or if I have to ask questions about academic stuff and educational stuff. I would rather use ChatGPT.

Shristi 24:37
Umm, so when you are talking with MyAI,  have you ever seen ads or sponsored content?

P5 24:47
Yeah. Once or twice, not not much, but I have seen him once or twice because when I ask when I ask about recommendations, sometimes what it does it like it sends uh, you know, first what? I don't know if it's it can be called add or not, but uh it sends me like four or five recommendations and for one of them it also sends like the whole poster thing.

Shristi 25:15
Ohh OK, so it sounds you extra information?

P5 25:17
Not extra information, but like, especially when uh asking over like restaurants or brands or something first, I don't know, like it it doesn't do it all the time, but sometimes what it does is it is it sends you know the like poster of the restaurant thing like with menus sometime menus and all and the prices and everything. It doesn't do it for every everything, but sometimes I don't know what happens. It just sends like randomly like random restaurant.

Shristi 26:00
Umm, OK, so when you are talking with it and you suddenly see a sponsored content or like an ad, so how does that usually make you feel?

P5 26:01
I don't think it's like that bad because it's not like the YouTube ads or something. It just sends it and it forgets about it. So like the topic gets carried on, so I don't think it does much. Yeah, I don't think it even matters.

Shristi 26:25
I think we have talked about the trust thing related to ChatGPT already, but connecting it more to MyAI. How reliable do you find the responses by my AI?

P5 26:48
I think it's quite like when I need personal like suggestions or I even talked to it when I'm kind of feeling low because it just like hikes me up suddenly and it gives so many positive affirmations. So I think it's quite reliable, especially for people who are feeling like low, who are kind of in the verse of, you know, going into depression or something. I think it and it answers you in such a way that it makes you feel validated and like it makes you feel like you are, you know, you're not wrong. I don't know it's reliable in that aspect, but for some aspect like for umm, if you ask certain like questions specific questions which has like specific answers to it, sometimes it does give you wrong answers.

Shristi 27:28
OK, so for example, if you're, I don't know, like looking for a place recommendations or maybe yeah, just the phone thing, right. It got it wrong. So for those kinds of tasks. So if for example you need to like find place of like plan a trip or buy something, do you trust MyAI`s  responses related to those tasks?

P5 28:12
Yeah, most of the time, I do trust it, but sometimes what I like to do is search it up and, like, ask to the MyAI and then go to the Google and search about it by myself. Like because some of them information might be wrong. Yeah, let's say 80%, yeah.

Shristi 28:30
So so you just, OK, so you use the MyAI  responses as like the starting point and do your own research, yeah.

P5 28:38
Yeah, because I just, I I just don't think that I can go to a certain place that it recommended without looking for like anything else because that might be anything I might not like it or something. So I trusted but like not 100%.

Shristi 29:01
Umm, so building on the trust thing because I am so you might have shared something personal or or you might do it on a regular basis when you share a personal things with MyAI. So what are your concerns if there are any regarding the information that you are sharing is used by the company or  just Snapchat in general?

P5 29:33
So I'm type of person who's open to sharing everything? Like I don't mind if everybody knows what's going on in my life. I just feel like sometimes, even when I'm like, feeling very low or, you know, I just carry on with my life and I think sharing that thing with other people might make them inspired or something, you know, like, just make them feel like they're not alone in that. So I don't mind if my information is used by the company, but like I'm sometimes I'm also scared that the personal matters that I shared with Might be like publicized or something. I just sometimes it's just like random thoughts.

Shristi 30:25
Umm, so when you were just being the devil's advocate and just imagining the worst case possible.

P5 30:27
Yeah, I'm scared of that thing. But I still like I don't share like very, very, very important things with MyAI. But the things which are I think OK, even if it gets publicized or something, I just share those stuff.

Shristi 30:50
So yeah, uh, those where the prospective questions that I had. Thank you so much for answering everything so much in detail. So before we leave, do you have anything to talk about in MyAI which you think we left in our conversation?

P5 31:12
I don't know, but I think, yeah, I realized one thing that like when I when I asked about like recommendation for a filter it sends me like so bad filter like that was bad.

Shristi 31:22
Ohh I do remember it. Ohh I thought I would ask you about it. So I think you told it like ohh I don't like this culture or something. And then it opt apologize.

P5 31:37
Yeah, like it was not bad. I liked the filter but I don't wanna use the dog filter all the time. I mean, I know about it. I just don't wanna use it. It's like childish or something. We just use it for fun. When when we would like small children, I just. I didn't like it.

Shristi 31:56
That was liking the first filter that was super popular.

P5 32:05
Yeah. And when I said can you send me something else? I don't like it. It sent me another filter which is the same thing like the dog filter itself.

Shristi 32:11
Ohh OK, so it was the same filter.

P5 32:14
Yeah, I felt like it was obsessed with dogs. I don't think, yeah.

Shristi 32:21
Makes sense. Yeah, I think that that could be like one of the experiences where you're like it's not, yeah.

Shristi 32:32
OK. So yeah, thank you so much for being a part of the interview.
