Transcript P3_Interview
March 21, 2024

Shristi started transcription

Kadir  0:12
OK, perfect.
So let's start then.
The recording has started.
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

P3   0:26
Yeah.
So my my full name is [P3].
I'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally.

Kadir  0:46
OK.
OK, senior in microbiology and genetics.

P3   0:49
Yes.

Kadir  0:50
OK and.
What social media platforms do you use?

P3   0:58
Ohm.
More often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah.

Kadir  1:06
It's not OK.
And when did you start using Snapchat?

P3   1:18
Ooh, I wanna say.
8-8 years ago or maybe 9?

Kadir  1:27
Eight or nine years ago.

P3   1:28
Umm.

Kadir  1:28
OK.
OK, that's good to know.
Umm.
And then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general?

P3   1:40
Ohm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat.

Kadir  1:51
Mm-hmm.

P3   1:51
So yeah, just chatting with friends.

Kadir  1:55
Friends.
OK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them.

P3   1:59
Umm.

Kadir  2:01
OK.
OK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes.
Got it.

P3   2:09
Yeah.

Kadir  2:09
So and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature?

P3   2:21
Umm.
I wanna say, well, when did it do?
You know when it began.

Kadir  2:29
I.

Shristi   2:30
I think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm.

P3   2:32
A year ago.
OK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much.

Kadir  2:38
Umm, when it first launched you either did it and then did.

P3   2:40
Umm.

Kadir  2:43
Did you use?
Since then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time.

P3   2:52
I used it when it first came out and then I didn't.
I guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again.

Kadir  3:01
OK.
That's fair and OK, so.

P3   3:03
Yeah.

Kadir  3:08
Just uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago.
So can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?
Umm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.
Just a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.

P3   3:44
Yeah, I like.
So with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.
Things to see in a specific place.
So if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.
What places can I see or what places can I eat?
And I like some of the suggestions that it gives.

Kadir  4:05
Hmm.
So mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions.
OK.

P3   4:10
Yeah.

Kadir  4:10
Yeah.
So make sense so.
Do you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those?
Recommendations for eating out or for a place to visit?

P3   4:31
Yeah.
So when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.
So then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.

Kadir  4:50
Hmm.

P3   4:52
So I liked that it kept that in mind.

Kadir  4:54
OK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?

P3   5:08
Uh.
OK, so if I were to put it on a scale of.

Kadir  5:15
Mm-hmm.

P3   5:16
I don't know one to five.
I guess I would say.
2 1/2.

Kadir  5:24
OK, in the middle. Mediocre.

P3   5:25
Yeah, yeah.

Kadir  5:28
OK.
Is there any?

P3   5:32
Reason.

Kadir  5:33
Reason that led to this rating.

P3   5:41
I just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.

Kadir  5:48
Hmm.

P3   5:48
If I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.

Kadir  6:10
Hmm. Uh, OK, but.

P3   6:16
So I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.

Kadir  6:42
Oh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?

P3   6:59
Umm. Sorry, let me think.

Kadir  7:13
Yes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.

P3   7:24
Umm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.
I didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.

Kadir  7:45
Umm. Umm.

P3   7:49
Otherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.

Shristi   8:14
If it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff.

P3   8:21
Yeah, that helps.

Shristi   8:26
Yeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like.

P3   8:31
OK Ohh now I remember.
OK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.

Kadir  9:00
Umm.

P3   9:01
So I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that.

Kadir  9:09
OK, OK. Yeah. Standing so. How much effort was required to use my AI chatbot? Uh. During your experiences?

P3   9:27
Umm, I don't think there was much effort, I feel like. MyAI was very good about.
To being responsive, especially in a in a quick manner. Umm..easy to understand.
Umm. But sometimes, like I said, if I wanted the my AI to give a specific answer, I would have to ask it. Ask the question a couple different ways to see if maybe it would be able to answer it better. And sometimes it could, sometimes it couldn't.

Kadir  10:05
Umm.

P3   10:07
But yeah, I would say so.

Kadir  10:09
OK.

P3   10:11
A little bit of effort, but not not much.

Kadir  10:14
Not much, OK. OK. Umm do you think? If any special skills are needed to use my AI chatbot well.

P3   10:35
Umm. I I don't think you would need and he's. I think anybody can use the MyAI.

Kadir  10:45
Hmm.
If I could remind you or answer you were saying that you you sort of [inaudible]?
Can, uh, when it was broad, not specific to get the answers you want.
So and at that time following experience that in any view observed or what kind of skills did it require?

P3   11:18
Umm, so could you repeat that question?

Kadir  11:23
I'm going to my as love like thank in the previous question.
You said you know when it was, what you said you had to ask different questions to what you want.
And was it kind of like what kind of things did it require and specific or special skills or was it kind of like effort effortful or not?

P3   11:48
Ohh. No, I mean, I don't, I don't think it required much effort, just I don't know, I would ask it maybe a second question or a third question. And then I think eventually it would understand what I was trying to ask of it.

Kadir  12:05
Umm. OK, OK. Umm. Did you encounter specific obstacles when using my AI?

P3   12:24
Umm. Some. Yeah, when it would ask, I mean when I would ask questions, it would provide links like with the shopping and some of the links wouldn't work. When I check them, umm obstacles wait. Is that where you are? You were asking, OK.

Kadir  12:45
Right. So the links were not working in some of those. Options OK.

P3   12:55
Yeah. And then for one of when I was asking about which food places to eat, UM, I remember it suggested this one restaurant. And then one and it said that the restaurant was, I don't know, uh Mexican based. And then when I looked it up, it was actually a French-based bakery, not a restaurant.

Kadir  13:17
Yeah.

P3   13:17
And I was like, oh, OK, you got that wrong. But it's fine.
And then when I told them MyAI.Ohh, you sure it's not French based that my I was like. Ohh yeah, you're right, it was French. My bad.
It was like OK. So it's like it's not always I want to say 100% accurate obviously, but.

Kadir  13:38
Umm.

P3   13:38
But I mean to use it for some basic tools is nice or for some basic answers is nice.

Kadir  13:46
Umm, OK, so do you like your test necessary resources to use MyAI properly?

P3   13:59
Ohh, I'm sorry I I think it's. I don't know if it's my Internet, but sometimes it cuts out.
Could you repeat that?

Kadir  14:07
Sure.
Do you feel like you have access to the necessary resources to use MyAI properly?

P3   14:21
Ohm, I wouldn't say yes. Umm, since I have since you can, I'm guessing you can use MyAI on the computer or on the phone. Then if I have one or the other, I'm able to use my AI.

Kadir  14:31
Mm-hmm.

P3   14:35
But if people who didn't have a phone or a computer, anything wouldn't be able to access have access to my AI.

Kadir  14:44
OK, OK.And have you heard somebody else talk about my AI? It it can be a friend, it can be an acquaintance or a media outlet. Have you heard it from somewhere else?

P3   15:04
Ohm. Yeah, I remember when ohm, when MyAI had, I think I had sent people a picture. Umm. And that was going around on social media and people were like ohh my God, what is my AI doing? It sent a picture.
I don't know. I guess people were trying to make MyAI seem like more of a person than it was a robot, so that's where I've heard it from other friends or either social media talking about MyAI.

Kadir  15:39
Mm-hmm. So, uh, this notion of more of a person is important. In fact, so can you a little bit elaborate on that.

P3   15:53
Yeah. So like this will show the person the human aspect of the my AI.
 
Kadir  16:02
Mm-hmm.

P3   16:02
Umm, I think it's it's nice that it's that it has the human aspect to it, because then it feels like I can talk to it more naturally because when I've talked to, let's say, chat, GPT, it's very formal and it just wants questions and answers, whereas MyAI is more of a conversation.

Kadir  16:12
Umm.
Hmm.
It seems OK, more like a conversation and then it makes it more human.
Uh. Features.

P3   16:32
Yeah, yeah.

Kadir  16:35
OK.
U], have you ever been encouraged by somebody you know or something posted on the Internet to use MyAII?

P3   16:46
Ohm. Yeah. So sometimes people would ask MyAI to, I don't know, create a song when it first came out, they were trying to see what they could get out of my AI.
So then there would be like people asking it, hey, can you create a song or can you?

Kadir  17:02
Hmm.

P3   17:08
I don't know.Help me write this essay or something, and I thought that was interesting, that it could do that. So I thought, oh, let me see what it can do.
And I think I remember asking it. Can you write a song and they came back with lyrics, I think, or something like that.

Kadir  17:21
Yeah.

P3   17:25
When it first came out.

Kadir  17:27
OK. That just to follow up. So you were kind of like seeing it among the friends that they were talking about this we when it OK and it was again on through Snapchat or from other social media platforms.

P3   17:37
Yeah. Through other social media platforms, talking about MyAI, I think it was like Twitter was talking about it.

Kadir  17:57
OK. Umm would you recommend trying my AI to your friends? Umm.
On on the Snapchat. Yeah, that you used during the study.

P3   18:20
I feel like it depends on what you stay have or what they want to use something for if they want. I don't know help with. In assignment or looking for. Or I guess I guess ChatGPT 4. Can use can help you look for research articles as well and what else could they do is help you with math problems. I know people use it for coding a lot if they're using it more academically.

Kadir  18:53
Umm.

P3   18:55
I think ChatGPT would be the better option if they're looking to. I don't know why, but if they're looking to have a conversation with a bot. They could use the my AI, but I feel like they're probably better resources out there than the MyAI. It seems very.
How do I put it? I feel like it's a little bit less advanced maybe than the other platforms that are out right now. And I feel like people don't see much of a use of the MyAI, but maybe younger people like to play with it more.

Kadir  19:29
Mm-hmm.

P3   19:38
So it's something that maybe younger people find more fun rather than useful.

Kadir  19:46
OK, OK.
Umm. Have you noticed any changes in your social media habits since using my AI?

P3   20:09
Gonna say that hasn't really changed.

Kadir  20:13
OK.

P3   20:13
How are you use anything? I guess sometimes I guess after the study I I checked the back onto MyAI and then asked it some things just to see what else it could.

Kadir  20:19
OK.

P3   20:28
It could do, but other than that, no, I haven't really looked at. UM, social media more after using MyAI.

Kadir  20:40
OK. Umm, so do you think you have used or are currently using something similar to my AI?

P3   20:54
Umm, I like using ChatGPT either to paraphrase or summarize something that I I don't know.

Kadir  20:59
Mm-hmm.

P3   21:04
Like if I'm reading a research article and I want to get something out of it, I like how chat GPT can make it easier for me to understand.

Kadir  21:13
Mm-hmm. Umm so. Compared to my AI, what do you think? What is the similarity or difference between? You said some, but still I would like to tap on this similarities or differences between MyAI and ChatGPT.

P3   21:43
I guess I guess the similarity is that they try to give give you resources. Umm, I don't know if if MyAI is pulling information from the Internet. I'm assuming it is umm, but ChatGPT is for sure doing that as well and the difference is is that I think. I think ChatGPT is more. How do it explain it? Is better at. I don't know with the abilities that it has, like the coding aspect. I don't think my AI can do that. Probably I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it probably couldn't help with that.

Kadir  22:33
Umm. Hmm. OK.
Umm, you said you have seen ads or sponsored content while interacting with.
Umm, So what do you think about getting these sponsored content or ads to your?
Prompts or questions to my AI. What is your feelings about them?

P3   23:09
Oh, are you talking about the links that it adds after it? Yeah.

Kadir  23:12
Umm.

P3   23:15
I felt like. Sometimes it was unnecessary if I was looking for a link and I just wanted to have the conversation, I felt like it was kind of distracting and unnecessary.

Kadir  23:26
Mm-hmm.

P3   23:31
Umm, but then when I did want the links it was able to provide that. But I don't think it needed to have that every every time.

Kadir  23:41
So it was it offering it every time, regardless of you want or not, there is a.

P3   23:46
Umhm.

Kadir  23:47
So you can't make it on and off.

P3   23:51
Oh, like in the settings. Am I able to turn it on and off?

Kadir  23:55
I don't know. I'm. I'm just asking. I don't know either.

P3   23:57
Ohh OK, I don't know. I mean, I didn't ask to stop providing links.
I might have asked if why it was providing links, but I don't remember if I did or not, but yeah I would.

Kadir  24:07
What?

P3   24:07
It would provide it in mostly every conversation, like if we were talking about, I don't know, for example if I was asking about whale watching, even though I wasn't expecting it to give me links. It would just give me links and I'm like OK, I'm not gonna go to Alaska right now, but alright.

Kadir  24:28
OK, so you said that whale watching thing is, how does my AI know it?
Can I quickly ask?

P3   24:41
Oh, like, how does it know what it is? Alright.

Kadir  24:44
Yeah.
Or you said you were watching it, right?

P3   24:47
Oh, oh, no, no.
I was just, uh, I just said Ohh.
I think we're watching would be cool in Alaska when I was talking about the trip and then that's when my I was like, ohh yeah, we're watching is cool and then it brings the link right after.

Kadir  24:54
Yeah. OK. So were those for example links or advertisements.
Also, did you find them for example related to your um preferences related to your location? I mean, did you ever observe those or were they more like very?
Generic.

P3   25:27
I think they were related to the preferences or at least related to the conversation that we were talking about.

Kadir  25:33
Umm OK. OK, so uh, how reliable do you find the responses by my AI? Do you trust its responses?

P3   25:49
Well, after it told me the bakery was Mexican based and then said just kidding. It's actually a French-based. I don't know. After that it was like yeah. Now I don't even know if I trust any of your responses.

Kadir  26:02
Did you? Yeah.

P3   26:02
So I I feel like it's probably 50-50.

Kadir  26:06
Hmm. Umm for the Alaska trip? I don't know. Have you had a chance to check the yeah responses? If they are, cannot more factual or more reliable, the things that the the package that it offers.

P3   26:26
Umm, I did. I didn't look through all of them, but some of the places that I looked at it, it seemed. It seemed real, I guess so I was like, OK, at least it exists.

Kadir  26:39
OK.

P3   26:43
But yeah, that that's all I really had the chance to look at.

Kadir  26:48
And then what was your shopping experience by the way, can you remind that to us? Shopping task.

P3   26:55
Yeah. I remember I was asking for. I think I was asking for.

Kadir  27:08
Right.

P3   27:09
I don't know places that I had really good deals.

Kadir  27:13
OK.

P3   27:15
And it was giving me.

Kadir  27:15
Or yeah, yeah.

P3   27:17
Ohh sorry what?

Kadir  27:19
Stores,. You mean?
Yeah.

P3   27:20
Yeah.

Kadir  27:20
I just remember, yeah.

P3   27:22
Yeah, and um it did give me some options and then I asked if it could give me provide me with stores that were online. So I didn't have to go in person.

Kadir  27:35
Umm.

P3   27:35
One of the stores I had never heard of, but I didn't take the time to look to see if the store was real or not, but I probably should have, yeah.

Kadir  27:43
OK.
OK, so uh, during your interactions with my AI, you might have shared something personal when interacting with MyAI. And what are your concerns regarding how the information or the data that you share with my AI or with Snapchat is used by Snapchat, let's say by the platform?

P3   28:15
Umm. I feel like I wouldn't trust getting too personal with it just because I don't know if, let's say Snapchat, or MyAI or something? The data would get breached.
I don't know..I mean, it happens occasionally with other companies, so I I don't know, I wouldn't ever feel comfortable being too personal with it.

Kadir  28:41
Hmm.
OK, OK. Umm it it it it, it makes sense.
Umm, so I think this brings us to the end of the interview. Would you have any questions before we finish it up? Anything to add lastly?

P3   29:05
Ohm.
I guess. I I think in the future I would maybe use the MyAI again if say I wanted to plan another trip or something. I did like that it gave me some things to look into and I could be like ohh, even if the restaurants weren't something that I liked, it gave me an idea of what I wanted to, umm wanted to get. Like if it was talking about French pastries, then I started looking at French pastries.
Even if I didn't like the recommendation it gave me, so it was, it was, I guess, kind of useful because it gave me ideas that I didn't think of before.

Kadir  29:57
OK. Got it. Like it is conversation starters or things for you? For more.

P3   29:59
Yeah.

Kadir  30:02
OK.
Yeah, definitely. This says this is a valid point to go back and maybe try again.
Yeah.
Thank you very much for attending us.
I don't know if should see as a question or not, but.

Shristi   30:15
Umm I I have a few more questions.
I'll just go ahead and ask your.
So do you see just to reel back a little bit?

P3   30:20
OK.

Shristi   30:25
So I was just looking at some of your screenshots and I found one of the screenshots on you day two when you were playing a game with it a little bit interesting. So I I see I saw that like you were playing 20 questions with it and then it took like a few guesses. Uh to to get into the answer, which was stapler, I think you were explaining what a stapler was and then it got it right after like a few tries.

P3   30:47
Ohh yeah.

Shristi   30:51
And then? You asked it.
Hey, like how many tries did you like take to get it right?
And then was like, hey, I took a few tries, but I'm glad I got it.
And then and then it like swerved and added to the conversation and it talked about, I think.
And it said, hey, what else is going on?
Are there any exciting plans that are coming off so I don't have more screenshots after that?
So did you, like, continue the conversation after that?
Do you remember anything from that day regarding it?

P3   31:24
Ohh I think I..I think I avoided that question. If I remember correctly and I started I said Ohh, let's turn it around. Can you? Can I start asking you the questions instead or something like that?

Shristi   31:42
Umm.

P3   31:43
So I guess I think I just played another game just to see what it would be like.

Shristi   31:44
OK.
Hmm.
OK, so so I think that would be a more hypothetical question at this point because you didn't really reply back, but what do you feel about the chat by giving you new?
Conversation starters.
Uh, which I think is encouraging you to spend more time on it.
So how do you feel about that interaction in general?

P3   32:15
Uh.
I feel like. It's doing a good job of keeping me engaged. Umm.
And when it asks new questions, I guess it makes me wanna stay on it longer and then interact with my AI more. Especially when it's, uh, saying things like ha ha and speaking naturally to me, it makes me feel like it almost makes me feel like I'm talking to another person.

Shristi   32:51
Umm OK.

P3   32:52
So it does make me want to stay longer and talk to it longer.

Shristi   32:57
Umm. And so in general, because you tried using the chatbot to for like four or five different things. So I see you've already tried using it in the past, so do you have umm any so either it's for you or for other people in general. What kind of things do you think MyAI is good for versus what my AI is bad for.

P3   33:36
I want to say it's good for.
I mean, I keep bringing this up, but.
Since I like food, I like exploring new food places.
I like that it gives me places that I haven't heard of before or thought of before, so I like that about the MyAI. I like that is. Responsive. Playful even?
Umm definitely.
When I've tried to talk to ChatGPT.
Yeah, it's just kind of curves me.
It's like, OK, ask me the question now.
And even if I'm trying to have a conversation with the, it's just like ask me the question, what do you need today? Whereas the MyAI will continue.
Having a conversation with you as long as you wanted to.
Umm. What?
It's bad for though.
I'm sure the ChatGPT is also not always accurate, but I feel like MyAI's even more less accurate.
If that mean it's even less accurate, there we go.
In a lot of a lot of things.
So I think that's what it's bad that.

Shristi   34:46
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, makes sense.
Ohm.
So I just, I'm trying to remember if I had one more question before you left.
I guess I was just looking at your screenshots and trying to think of things that OK.
So final questions not relevant to the screenshot but umm so if because I think at the time when you were talking with it at times you were feeling frustrated about it not giving you the correct links or you having to switch up what you were asking for to get the correct answers, so at the time. Do you feel you had any support that you needed for actually using it properly?

P3   35:41
I wish there was.
I don't know a proper introduction for MyAI.
I don't think I mean, at least I don't remember Snapchat giving a proper introduction for even saying what it's good for.
It's just.
I just remember it appearing and everybody talking about, Oh my God, there's this robot now on Snapchat, but.
Because I I still didn't even know what it was for.
Really, until this study, I guess I kind of got the hang of what it really was meant for.
Maybe.
But even then, I'm still unsure what it's really used for.
If it's more for conversation rather than looking for resources.

Shristi   36:29
Hmm.
Yeah, makes sense.
OK, I think that's all I had.
So thank you so much.
I'll.
I'll pass it back to Kadir.
Where you left it off.

Kadir  36:45
Yeah.
Thank you very much for.
Yeah.
Hating in our diary study.
And so at the same time, and enjoy.
Uh, Daisy.
Uh, let's just kind of like is our session very much.
Would you like to right now?

P3   37:11
Oh wait, sorry.
Did you say something like?
Are you asking me a question?

Kadir  37:14
I'm just saying, are we?
Are we able to right now end the conversation the interview?

P3   37:20
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very good.

Kadir  37:29
Bye, bye.

P3   37:30
Goodbye.
