Kadir  0:12
OK, perfect.
So let's start then.
The recording has started.
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

P3   0:26
Yeah.
So my my full name is [P3].
I'm currently a senior as an undergrad at [a US university] and I study microbiology and genetics and I I guess I use Snapchat occasionally like not too often but occasionally.

Kadir  0:46
OK.
OK, senior in microbiology and genetics.

P3   0:49
Yes.

Kadir  0:50
OK and.
What social media platforms do you use?

P3   0:58
Ohm.
More often, I guess I would say Snapchat and Instagram pretty much it, yeah.

Kadir  1:06
It's not OK.
And when did you start using Snapchat?

P3   1:18
Ooh, I wanna say.
8-8 years ago or maybe 9?

Kadir  1:27
Eight or nine years ago.

P3   1:28
Umm.

Kadir  1:28
OK.
OK, that's good to know.
Umm.
And then what do you do most on the Snapchat in general?

P3   1:40
Ohm recently, I want to say just chatting with people that don't use other platforms and mostly use Snapchat.

Kadir  1:51
Mm-hmm.

P3   1:51
So yeah, just chatting with friends.

Kadir  1:55
Friends.
OK, mostly friends that you know and then kind of like just chatting with them.

P3   1:59
Umm.

Kadir  2:01
OK.
OK, so for chatting it is mostly for chatting purposes.
Got it.

P3   2:09
Yeah.

Kadir  2:09
So and then and why did you start using this Snapchat my AI feature?

P3   2:21
Umm.
I wanna say, well, when did it do?
You know when it began.

Kadir  2:29
I.

Shristi   2:30
I think it was like a year ago, like a year ago. Mm-hmm.

P3   2:32
A year ago.
OK, that one is say I did use it a little bit a year ago, but not not much.

Kadir  2:38
Umm, when it first launched you either did it and then did.

P3   2:40
Umm.

Kadir  2:43
Did you use?
Since then, a little bit from time to time or you use the OR gave some space and time.

P3   2:52
I used it when it first came out and then I didn't.
I guess I didn't really see the point of it, so I didn't use it again.

Kadir  3:01
OK.
That's fair and OK, so.

P3   3:03
Yeah.

Kadir  3:08
Just uh, you know, in our study, you completed the diary study with my AI on Snapchat and also, as you said, you kind of like started using it almost a year ago.
So can you walk me through an example of how you use my AI?
Umm you can think about your recent experience during the diary study or prior experiences.
Just a specific example of you know, just just walk us through that please.

P3   3:44
Yeah, I like.
So with the my eye from all the experiences that I've had with it, I've like to asking if for.
Things to see in a specific place.
So if I'm traveling somewhere, I can ask it.
What places can I see or what places can I eat?
And I like some of the suggestions that it gives.

Kadir  4:05
Hmm.
So mostly for trips and then like eating suggestions.
OK.

P3   4:10
Yeah.

Kadir  4:10
Yeah.
So make sense so.
Do you have any specific example that you would love to share with us from those?
Recommendations for eating out or for a place to visit?

P3   4:31
Yeah.
So when I asked my AI about, I don't know, taking a trip to Alaska, I like the recommendations it gave me because it took into account from the conversation we had earlier about whale watching.
So then it put that into the suggestions as to what I should go see later on when I asked it what I could do in Alaska.

Kadir  4:50
Hmm.

P3   4:52
So I liked that it kept that in mind.

Kadir  4:54
OK. OK, kept it conversation. So based on your experiences, have you ever found MyAI useful?

P3   5:08
Uh.
OK, so if I were to put it on a scale of.

Kadir  5:15
Mm-hmm.

P3   5:16
I don't know one to five.
I guess I would say.
2 1/2.

Kadir  5:24
OK, in the middle. Mediocre.

P3   5:25
Yeah, yeah.

Kadir  5:28
OK.
Is there any?

P3   5:32
Reason.

Kadir  5:33
Reason that led to this rating.

P3   5:41
I just feel like. For some of the answers it was very vague.

Kadir  5:48
Hmm.

P3   5:48
If I was trying to lead it to a specific to get it to have a specific answer, it wouldn't have one or I don't know. Sometimes I would ask it to do something like hey, are you able to? I don't know. Remind me some about something for like the next day and then it wouldn't do it, but it would remember that I told it to do it.

Kadir  6:10
Hmm. Uh, OK, but.

P3   6:16
So I thought that was interesting. Sometimes there's confusion with the what it wants. Uh, with some of the questions that I ask the MyAI so it would ask me to keep clarifying. Don't know the answer is just wouldn't be what I was wanting it to be, if that makes sense.

Kadir  6:42
Oh yeah, in fact, this is kind of bringing me to the next question, which is, can you please share an experience where MyAI met your expectations or didn't meet your expectations?

P3   6:59
Umm. Sorry, let me think.

Kadir  7:13
Yes, definitely. I think you talked about a couple things and if there is any follow up on the those that would be nice.

P3   7:24
Umm. I guess in terms of asking about the trips? Umm, it meant my expectations because or I think it went kind of above my expectations.
I didn't expect it to be as thorough as it was. It wasn't very thorough, but thorough enough that I thought you did a good job. Umm.

Kadir  7:45
Umm. Umm.

P3   7:49
Otherwise. Umm. So in some parts it didn't meet my expectations when. I don't know. Let's see. I'm trying to remember what I was asking it to do.

Shristi   8:14
If it helps you in your task, one day you were supposed to do shopping in it. One day you were supposed to play games the other day the pictures and the stickers stuff.

P3   8:21
Yeah, that helps.

Shristi   8:26
Yeah. So you can choose from anyone that you like.

P3   8:31
OK Ohh now I remember.
OK, so when it didn't meet my expectations, it was the day that we had to upload a picture and I was like, hey, can you describe this to me? And it said Ohh it's a cake and I'm like, OK, so we can see that it's a cake. But other than that, it couldn't tell me the details about the cake like that. There was fruit on it. Or or what kind of fruit or what color it was, it could only tell me that it was a cake.

Kadir  9:00
Umm.

P3   9:01
So I thought ohh if I were to needed to interpret all their pictures. It really wouldn't be able to do that.
