Kadir   0:15
OK, perfect. So.
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, if possible?

P2   0:25
Little about myself?
Kadir   0:27
Yes, yes.

P2   0:27
OK, so I'm a graduate student here, here at the [a US university], and now graduating this year.
So I'm doing my civil engineering masters in civil engineering with an emphasis on Geotechnical engineering. I think I have been using Snapchat for the past three years. If you want to know.

Kadir   0:50
Wow. Past three years, it's been quite a few kind of like experience probably it seems alright So then could you also tell me what social media platforms do you use other than, let's say, in this case, Snapchat?

P2   1:10
Uh, so Instagram. Facebook, mostly on Instagram and mostly Instagram. Other than that, Facebook, sometimes with Twitter, and that's all. If LinkedIn counts as social media, I did that while I was searching for jobs, but not anymore.

Kadir   1:28
So we get an Instagram. Facebook OK. Yeah, that's that's fair. So. When when did you start using Snapchat? Uh.

P2   1:46
So yeah, it was like back and forth when I when I was back in [a South Asian Country]. So I usually use for like one month and then the not use that for like one year and then again come back.
But after I came to US like it's been like 2 years, most probably. So I've been like continuously using it for the past two years.I would say.

Kadir   2:05
No. OK. So just. Is there any umm what makes a continuous use in the US for Snapchat?
Is there any kind of like reason for?

P2   2:18
And now, and there's not, not not this kind of disparity while competing with [a South Asian Country] and US, but just that when I am in the US, I could like connect with my friends, move through Snapchat with home in [a South Asian Country] So back back when I was in [a South Asian Country], I didn't didn't need to do that because I was actually there. So that makes it easy to like...

Kadir   2:36
OK, OK. Yeah.

P2   2:37
..know what they're doing like in their daily life. And like you know about their situations, where it's pretty fun.

Kadir   2:43
Yeah, I got it. That makes sense. That makes sense. I relate to that for sure.

P2   2:49
Yeah.

Kadir   2:50
What do you do most on on the on the Snapchat then could you tell us a little bit?

P2   2:56
Yeah. So. So I'm like pretty much print circle like there are like two or three groups one those group that I used to hang out in [a South Asian Country]l. So that is my most prominent group or the group where I am actually the most. So just so anything you're doing in your daily life, if it, if it is fun, or even if it's like normal, just pick a picture and then say something and just send them to your friends and they will react probably. Or just watch it and just reply it on their own. So yeah, it's kind of like to. So what you're doing on a bit daily basis, so it's kind of fun.

Kadir   3:28
OK, sharing, sharing, maybe sharing your life on a daily basis and then getting getting to know what others are doing as well.

P2   3:32
Yeah, yeah, that post. Wasting your story on Instagram or post on Instagram is like too much of a job, so we Snapchat this kinda like easier version for that one. If you want like really keep it small, your friends circle, yeah.

Kadir   3:45
OK, OK. Yeah, I I got it. And yeah, I mean, in terms of my AI feature, when and why did you, why did you start using my AI feature on Snapchat?

P2   4:02
Uh, so when it was first released, I don't know when it was exactly, but I think it has been like one year or so. I don't know exactly, so I just tried to play play, play around with that when it was first released, but to be honest, after that I haven't really used this before this program or before your project.

Kadir   4:10
Umm.

P2   4:22
So yeah, I don't have very much experience than you guys as well, so.

Kadir   4:22
Umm.
Yeah, but just I wanna clarify before we asked you, you, you used it before, right? And then it was.

P2   4:32
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used it before here.

Kadir   4:35
Yeah. OK. So is it was it visible to you easily when when it?

P2   4:39
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it it remain remains on the top of your chat field whenever you Instagram.

Kadir   4:44
Umm.

P2   4:45
So it was like kind of in the plane sight all the time butI I haven't really used it.

Kadir   4:53
OK, OK. Uh, so it seems. Possibly with our study you, uh, maybe made more experiences with MyAI feature.

P2   5:07
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

Kadir   5:08
Uh, yeah.

P2   5:08
I did.

Kadir   5:09
So then can you walk us, can you walk us through an example of how you used it? I mean it could be related to what you did during our study or it could be related to before it wasn't related to the study.

P2   5:21
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm going to take a look at the screenshots right now because I forgot what you first was. What was the first task? If you can remind me.

Kadir   5:34
I think we asked you to have a travel recommendation.

P2   5:39
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was the one that I liked the most, so I didn't think that it would like do something like this. So I just asked it like I want to just pick spend three nights and four days.
I have this much budget and I like nature, so can you please plan a trip for me then? Then the first answer was kind of like a decent one. It was not that detailed, but I asked it to again, like going to the detail and give me a full itinerary.

Kadir   5:58
Umm.

P2   6:03
It give me a full itinerary of like day one, day, two, day three, day four, even with all the pricing.
So I..I was kind of like I didn't check if the pricings were correct or not, but still this was like really good experience for me. So if you have like less time on planning the travel then it could be really helpful thing.

Kadir   6:20
Ohh OK, so it was initially not that much detail, but later gave more details.

P2   6:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Kadir   6:27
OK. Yeah, it was for the travel one. OK. So is it normally have you use it or is it? Was it something a different experience with that first task?

P2   6:40
No, to this kind of like similar to what I usually do when I am using generative AI. So first of all I try to get a little bit of information and then if it provides me with the correct results and then I tried to go into the details. So it was like very similar to this one as well. So I think that this is how it usually goes when I try to like search anything on Snapchat.

Kadir   6:59
OK, OK. So then have you ever found MyAI useful? During this study or during your prior experiences.

P2   7:16
My prior experience will I I once played a game with MyAI based on like prior to what you guys sent me before you what you guys sent me. I I played the "guess the country's flag" game with it, and I added fun. I had to kill the time in the in the airport at sometimes. So at that time, so it was really fun. And I think that's all I have.

Kadir   7:34
Umm.

P2   7:36
It's like kind of. It's not like as usable as ChatGPT, I must say, but just to like have something on your phone to like type and can play with, so it's it's kind of cool.

Kadir   7:47
Yeah. OK, so it means more like maybe I don't know, like kill time at the time and then.

P2   7:53
You're saying like like a friendly suggestion or something like that. If you just need to like fool around. Maybe. Yeah, but after your study, after this project that you guys asked me to do with along with you. So I feel like it can like use them more, use it any other ways as well so using a better way than just fool around with it.

Kadir   8:08
Mm-hmm. So. So just, uh, you brought ChatGPT into conversation. What makes I mean in terms of usefulness? ChatGPT versus my AI different on your experience?

P2   8:31
OK, so to be honest, so I use this on my phone. And ChatGPT, mostly on my laptop, so whenever I'm working on my thesis or something like that. So it's really accessible to just open another tab and just type..just use ChatGPT instead of like try to like type in the phone and ask it. Ask the MyAI feature on Snapchat. So yeah, ChatGPT is like more accessible for me. So that's why I mentioned and is the most used AI feature that I've used till now. So I just had a quick comparison between these two.

Kadir   9:01
Hmm. OK. Yeah, so. Can you share an experience where MyAI met your expectations?

P2   9:17
With my expectations, OK, so.

Kadir   9:20
Mm-hmm.

P2   9:24
Umm. Let's see. I'm gonna. I'm going over the project tasks. You gave me the task, so the last task was asking about a photo right, photo or sticker.

Kadir   9:37
Yes.

P2   9:39
It didn't perform that well on this one. So I think the first the first tasks that you give like plan a holiday or vacation like that was the most accurate and like most detailed part that I received from the GPT because other than that the shopping task was a failure for me because I wanted to like try and ask them to ask, yeah, MyAI to like give me first suggestion on soccer cleats but didn't like it, didn't like provide like such great information on that.
And also the last one asking with the picture I sent them a picture of a dish called Momo in [a South Asian Country]. It didn't recognize that and also like it has like some other I would do it, period.
It's going like provide much information about there.
So I think the vacation one was like pretty well planned or I received like very good feedback from MyAI. So, that was the best one and I must say the asking about the picture was the worst one.

Kadir   10:41
The first one.

P2   10:42
Yeah. The first one was the. Yeah, it was the best one.

Kadir   10:46
The the most useful. OK, the most which kind of met your expectations, got it.

P2   10:52
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Kadir   10:54
Yeah, I mean, I remember in that one it gave a place to you from Colorado as far as I remember.

P2   11:03
I..I think it was. Yeah. I asked it for like suggestion for a natural place, so I think Rocky, Rocky Mountains.

Kadir   11:10
Rocky mountains.

P2   11:11
Yeah.

Kadir   11:14
So do you think is that place whereas more like based on your I mean?

P2   11:20
That's where I would go. Yeah, absolutely.
I gave it a prompt saying that I like nature, beaches and anything else except the city life.

Kadir   11:23
OK.

P2   11:29
So and then it suggests to the Rocky Mountains. So yeah, that's a place where I would definitely go in the future, so.

Kadir   11:36
Maybe that's why you it could be aligning. OK, OK.

P2   11:40
Yeah.
