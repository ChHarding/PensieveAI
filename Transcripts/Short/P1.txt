Shristi 0:07
Ok.
OK, so we have started the recording and transcription.
I just move ahead and start with a few warm-up questions.
So can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
P1 0:21
Sure. Umm.
So my name is [--].
I'm currently a second-year master's student in the HCI program.
This is my second to last semester.
Umm before that I'm.
I'm from [a US state], but originally I was born in [an East Asian Country] and I went to [a US
university] for mechanical engineering and I did that for I did Engineering for like 2 years.
Decided that it wasn't for me, so I wanted to pivot to something a little more creative and so
here I am in the HCI program and my goal eventually is to be a UX designer.
Shristi 1:02
Umm, thank you.
So which social media platforms are using currently?
P1 1:10
Umm, right now I think my my biggest ones are probably like Reddit and Tiktok.
Shristi 1:22
And Tiktok.
OK umm so.
Umm.
So when did you for Snapchat, since we've already settled that youâ€™ve been using Snapchat for
some time and you use it at least once a week, so when did you so?
P1 1:31
Umm.
Shristi 1:38
Do you remember when you started using Snapchat?
P1 1:41
Yeah, I started using Snapchat when I was in high school, so it has been about seven years
since I first started using it.
And I was definitely a lot more active on it early on.
I'd say, like I was active in high school and for most of College, but then after college, I think
guys started caring less about it just because, like, a lot of my friends also started caring less
about it and they stopped posting as much.
And my primary usage of Snapchat is just to check up on my friend's stories.
Shristi 2:15
Umm.
P1 2:20
So because like umm, we're not like actively on it as much.
And my friends aren't.
I don't go it on it too much anymore.
I literally check it like once a week just to see if there's anything going on, but usually there's
nothing.
Shristi 2:36
Umm.
OK.
So yeah, so when you say you're checking what's going on, are you just checking the stories or
are you also checking individual texts from your friends, family, et cetera?
P1 2:51
Yeah.
So I'm like permanently on do not disturb mode, so I like don't really get any notifications from
any social media. So I have to go in there and check if like anyone sent me a message and
usually it would be like my friend sent me a snap like directly to me and if not then I'll check like
other people's stories.
Shristi 3:16
OK, so do you also actively, you know, snap something and send it to your friends or family?
P1 3:23
I do.
It's usually like as a response to other people, or maybe like friends that I haven't seen in a
while.
Shristi 3:30
Yeah, and.
P1 3:34
And like I'm not, I don't really like text them or like. Umm. Interact with them much on other
social media, but like we used to. So uh, snap back and forth a lot.
So I would be more inclined to use Snapchat to like talk with those friends.
Like if I think of them every once in a while.
Shristi 3:54
Hmm.
OK, makes sense.
So how do you ever used or tried using the MyAI feature before this study?
P1 4:03
Umm, I actually have not used it.
I..I remember seeing it like when I updated my app at one point and my first thought was like I
really had no interest in trying it.
Umm.
Shristi 4:20
Yeah. OK.
P1 4:21
It just seemed like it's like another..like digital products that has like co-opted AI for, like, no
reason in particular. And I've seen, like a couple funny interactions on social media about it.
Like back when it was first released and it wasn't like that good yet and like there were some
some funny things I saw on social media. So just from like that experience, I..I never really tried
it out.
Shristi 4:53
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Ohm.
So I will move to questions about the usefulness that you saw while interacting with it for the
past few days now.
P1 5:06
Umm.
Shristi 5:06
Umm, can you walk me through an example out of like any of the interactions that you did,
within and outside of our study where you could show me an example of how you used MyAI?
So you can show like maybe an example of where you started and how it went.
P1 5:23
Sure.
Shristi 5:27
If you remember it.
P1 5:29
Yeah.
So did you say like it's OK to use an example that I already mentioned in the study?
Shristi 5:35
Yeah, of course.
P1 5:37
OK, sure.
So the one I remember the most was my first time using it.
Umm.
And it was to schedule a, excuse me, to plan an itinerary for a city like a three-night trip in any
any city in the US.
Shristi 5:56
Umm.
P1 6:00
And so for that one.
I wanted to do Indianapolis because that's where I'm from, and so I thought it would help me.
Shristi 6:07
Umm.
P1 6:08
Like decide better if like the..like the recommendations are good.
Shristi 6:16
Mm-hmm.
P1 6:16
So umm, so I remember just like logging in and like I guess I thought of the AI more as like a
person because it like has a Avatar.
So like I think the first thing I said was like, hi, how are you?
Shristi 6:28
Umm.
P1 6:32
Like how I would talk to a person, but like I wouldn't be saying that to like chat gibt or like any
other like faceless AI model.
Shristi 6:41
No.
P1 6:42
So it was interesting that I like felt like doing that.
And then I..I went into asking like, what I would recommend for a three-night itinerary in
Indianapolis.
And I've noticed that my like conversation.
No, like style was a lot more like casual, like I wasn't too like..careful about like ohh I need to
make this prompt like perfect so this machine can understand what I'm saying. Like I was sort
of just speaking like how I would to old friend. Umm. And it gave me back.
Well, at first I think I like thought it was a three-day itinerary instead of a three night. So I asked
for a three day and it it gave me back and itinerary that I thought it was like actually decent like I
would. I would be happy like doing these things for three days. And I remember like sending
the itinerary to my friends. I have a group chat with my friends from Indianapolis and I was like
hey, the Snapchat AI recommended me this. So like, since you guys are also from Indianapolis,
like, what do you think just so I have like more opinions than just my own and they also thought
it was pretty good. But then one of them was like, you know, I think copilot would give you a
better answer because like, they would actually source their like facts.
P1 8:15
Umm.
So yeah, even though the suggestions were good and like Snapchat, AI did give me like a
couple links to like, some of the places it was recommending. I think it was not like super
detailed about how it reached those conclusions.
Shristi 8:34
Umm.
P1 8:35
And it didn't really give me any like sources of like why it thought that this would be a good idea
to recommend to me. Even though the final recommendations were good and I also I..I've
realized I made a mistake by saying a three-day itinerary instead of a three-night.
So I asked it again. Like, hey, could you? Add an extra day in to the itinerary.
I actually wanted three night and it did add an.. an extra one day.. like it understood what I was
saying, which I was like impressed by.
Umm. And I also asked for like like this is just for my own fun. Like I was asking, like how much
should I budget for this trip? And so it gave me an initial budget for three nights, and then an
updated budget for three days. And I thought I wasn't impressed at like it could do that also,
even though, like, I think looking closely at it, I think some of the estimations were like a little off
like it estimated that I would spend like 20 bucks for Uber for the entire like, 4 days.
Shristi 9:30
Umm.
P1 9:45
And I'm like, I don't know about that.
Shristi 9:48
Yeah.
P1 9:48
And also like no source is either about like how it reached these estimations. So yeah, from
from that experience I think I was like pleasantly surprised at like how good it did or like that
gave me like like, actually, like good recommendations. But I was like, disappointed that it didn't
give me sources.
Umm oh and I also remember. I think later in that conversation I was I wanted to try to ask it
something else. So I said. So what are some like Asian restaurants you would recommend to
me in Indianapolis? Because I love like Asian food and it recommended me a bunch of places in
Austin, TX, which is like the city I currently live in.
Shristi 10:46
Mm-hmm.
P1 10:46
And so I think at some point in the conversation..it like lost the train of thought and like it didn't
think I was talking about the same things anymore.
Shristi 10:55
Yeah.
P1 10:58
Like the same like trip when I actually was, but I like.
Shristi 10:59
Umm, you know?
P1 11:02
I thought I was clear personally that we were still talking about the same trip.
Umm, but yeah umm after like I corrected it..it was fine.
Shristi 11:14
Ohh OK so yeah, so sometimes it does it. So you were talking about what, like a few things in a
chain? I think sometimes ChatGPT does that too. We're talking about a certain topic and then it
forgets about it and gives you something else.
P1 11:27
Yeah.
Shristi 11:28
So yeah, so much for sharing that.
